<span style="font-size: 173%">Translator's Introduction.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The publication of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Human,
        all-too-Human</span></span> extends over the period 1878-1880. Of the
        two divisions which constitute the Second Part, <span class="tei tei-q">“Miscellaneous Maxims and Opinions”</span> appeared in
        1879, and <span class="tei tei-q">“The Wanderer and his
        Shadow”</span> in 1880, Nietzsche being then in his thirty-sixth
        year. The Preface was added in 1886. The whole book forms Nietzsche's
        first lengthy contribution to literature. His previous works comprise
        only the philological treatises, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Birth of
        Tragedy</span></span>, and the essays on Strauss, Schopenhauer, and
        Wagner in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thoughts out of Season</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the volumes
        of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Human,
        all-too-Human</span></span> Nietzsche appears for the first time in
        his true colours as philosopher. His purely scholarly publications,
        his essays in literary and musical criticism—especially the essay on
        Richard Wagner at Bayreuth—had, of course, foreshadowed his work as a
        thinker.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These efforts,
        however, had been mere fragments, from which hardly any one could
        observe that a new philosophical star had arisen on the horizon. But
        by 1878 the period of transition had definitely set in. Outwardly,
        the new departure is marked by Nietzsche's resignation in that year
        of his professorship <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg
        viii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgviii"></a>
        at Bâle—a resignation due partly to ill-health, and partly to his
        conviction that his was a voice that should speak not merely to
        students of philology, but to all mankind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nietzsche himself
        characterises <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Human, all-too-Human</span></span> as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the monument of a crisis.”</span> He might
        as fitly have called it the first-fruits of a new harvest. Now, for
        the first time, he practises the form which he was to make so
        peculiarly his own. We are told—and we may well believe—that the book
        came as a surprise even to his most intimate friends. Wagner had
        already seen how matters stood at the publication of the first part,
        and the gulf between the two probably widened on the appearance of
        the Second Part.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Several aphorisms
        are here, varying in length as in subject, and ranging over the whole
        human province—the emotions and aspirations, the religions and
        cultures and philosophies, the arts and literatures and politics of
        mankind. Equally varied is the range of style, the incisive epigram
        and the passage of pure poetry jostling each other on the same page.
        In this curious power of alternating between cynicism and lyricism,
        Nietzsche appears as the prose counterpart of Heine.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One or two of the
        aphorisms are of peculiar interest to English readers. The essay (as
        it may almost be called) on Sterne (p. <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg060">60</a>, No. 113) does ample justice, if not more than
        justice, to that wayward genius. The allusion to Milton (p. <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg077">77</a>, No. 150) will come as somewhat
        of a shock to English readers, especially to those who hold that in
        Milton Art triumphed over Puritanism. It <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgix"></a> should be remembered, however, that Nietzsche's
        view coincides with Goethe's. The dictum that Shakespeare's gold is
        to be valued for its quantity rather than its quality (p. <a class="tei tei-ref pginternal" href="#Pg081">81</a>, No. 162) also betrays a certain
        exclusiveness—a legacy from that eighteenth-century France which
        appealed so strongly to Nietzsche on its intellectual side. To
        Nietzsche, as to Voltaire, Shakespeare is after all <span class="tei tei-q">“the great barbarian.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The title of the
        book may be explained from a phrase in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thus Spake
        Zarathustra</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Verily, even the
        greatest I found—all-too-human.”</span> The keynote of these volumes
        is indeed disillusion and destruction. Nor is this to be wondered at,
        for all men must sweep away the rubbish before they can build. Hence
        we find here little of the constructive philosophy of Nietzsche—so
        far as he had a constructive philosophy. The Superman appears but
        faintly, the doctrine of Eternal Recurrence not at all. For this very
        reason, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Human, all-too-Human</span></span> is perhaps
        the best starting-point for the study of Nietzsche. The difficulties
        in style and thought of the later work—difficulties that at times
        become well-nigh insuperable in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thus Spake Zarathustra</span></span>—are here
        practically absent. The book may, in fact, almost be described as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“popular,”</span> bearing the same relation
        to Nietzsche's later productions as Wagner's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tannhäuser</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lohengrin</span></span>
        bear to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ring</span></span>.</p>

        thanks are due to Mr. Thomas Common for his careful revision of the
        manuscript and many valuable suggestions.</p>

          guessed that I have many below me.... But first I always needed

          for the additional knowledge of the world, something that I had

          <span class="tei tei-q">“behind-me.”</span> Some even, like the
          first three <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thoughts out of Season</span></span>, must be
          thrown back before the period of creation and experience of a
          previously published book (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Birth of Tragedy</span></span> in the case
          cited, as any one with subtle powers of observation and comparison
          could not fail to perceive). That wrathful outburst against the
          Germanism, smugness, and raggedness of speech of old David Strauss,
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg002"></a> contents of the
          first <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thought out of Season</span></span>, gave a
          vent to feelings that had inspired me long before, as a student, in
          the midst of German culture and cultured Philistinism (I claim the
          paternity of the now much used and misused phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“cultured Philistinism”</span>). What I said against
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“historical disease”</span> I said as
          one who had slowly and laboriously recovered from that disease, and
          who was not at all disposed to renounce <span class="tei tei-q">“history”</span> in the future because he had suffered
          from her in the past. When in the third <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thought out of
          Season</span></span> I gave expression to my reverence for my first
          and only teacher, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great</span></em> Arthur Schopenhauer—I should
          now give it a far more personal and emphatic voice—I was for my
          part already in the throes of moral scepticism and dissolution,
          that is, as much concerned with the criticism as with the study of
          all pessimism down to the present day. I already did not believe in
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a blessed thing,”</span> as the people
          say, not even in Schopenhauer. It was at this very period that an
          unpublished essay of mine, <span class="tei tei-q">“On Truth and
          Falsehood in an Extra-Moral Sense,”</span> came into being. Even my
          ceremonial oration in honour of Richard Wagner, on the occasion of
          his triumphal celebration at Bayreuth in 1876—Bayreuth signifies
          the greatest triumph that an artist has ever won—a work that bears
          the strongest stamp of <span class="tei tei-q">“individuality,”</span> was in the background an act of
          homage and gratitude to a bit of the past in me, to the fairest but
          most perilous calm of my sea-voyage ... and as a matter of fact a
          severance and a farewell. (Was Richard Wagner mistaken on this
          point? I do not think so. So long as we still love, we do not paint
          such pictures, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg
          003]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg003"></a>
          we do not yet <span class="tei tei-q">“examine,”</span> we do not
          place ourselves so far away as is essential for one who
          <span class="tei tei-q">“examines.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Examining needs at least a secret antagonism, that of
          an opposite point of view,”</span> it is said on page 46 of the
          above-named work itself, with an insidious, melancholy application
          that was perhaps understood by few.) The composure that gave me the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">power</span></em> to speak after many
          intervening years of solitude and abstinence, first came with the
          book, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Human, All-too Human</span></span>, to which
          this second preface and apologia<a href="#note_1" id="noteref_1" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> is
          dedicated. As a book for <span class="tei tei-q">“free
          spirits”</span> it shows some trace of that almost cheerful and
          inquisitive coldness of the psychologist, who has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">behind</span></em>
          him many painful things that he keeps <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">under</span></em>
          him, and moreover establishes them for himself and fixes them
          firmly as with a needle-point. Is it to be wondered at that at such
          sharp, ticklish work blood flows now and again, that indeed the
          psychologist has blood on his fingers and not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> on
          his fingers?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was then, in
          fact, high time to bid farewell, and I soon received proof. Richard
          Wagner, who seemed all-conquering, but was in reality only a
          decayed and despairing romantic, suddenly collapsed, helpless and
          broken, before the Christian Cross.... Was there not a single
          German with eyes in his head and sympathy in his heart for this
          appalling spectacle? Was I the only one whom he caused—suffering?
          In any case, the unexpected event illumined for me in one lightning
          flash the place that I had abandoned, and also the horror that is
          felt by every one who is unconscious of a great danger until he has
          passed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg
          005]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg005"></a>
          through it. As I went forward alone, I shuddered, and not long
          afterwards I was ill, or rather more than ill—weary: weary from my
          ceaseless disappointment about all that remained to make us modern
          men enthusiastic, at the thought of the power, work, hope, youth,
          love, flung to all the winds: weary from disgust at the effeminacy
          and undisciplined rhapsody of this romanticism, at the whole tissue
          of idealistic lies and softening of conscience, which here again
          had won the day over one of the bravest of men: last, and not
          least, weary from the bitterness of an inexorable suspicion—that
          after this disappointment I was doomed to mistrust more thoroughly,
          to despise more thoroughly, to be alone more thoroughly than ever
          before. My task—whither had it flown? Did it not look now as if my
          task were retreating from me and as if I should for a long future
          period have no more right to it? What was I to do to endure this
          most terrible privation?—I began by entirely forbidding myself all
          romantic music, that ambiguous, pompous, stifling art, which robs
          the mind of its sternness and its joyousness and provides a fertile
          soil for every kind of vague yearning and spongy sensuality.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Cave musicam”</span> is even to-day my
          advice to all who are enough of men to cling to purity in matters
          of the intellect. Such music enervates, softens, feminises, its
          <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal feminine”</span> draws
          us—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">down</span></em>!<a href="#note_2" id="noteref_2" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> My
          first suspicion, my most immediate precaution, was directed against
          romantic music. If I hoped for anything at all from music, it
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg006"></a> was in the
          expectation of the coming of a musician bold, subtle, malignant,
          southern, healthy enough to take an immortal revenge upon that
          other music.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lonely now and

          everything that hurt me and was hard to me. Thus I once more found
          the way to that courageous pessimism that is the antithesis of all
          romantic fraud, and, as it seems to me to-day, the way to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“myself,”</span> to my task. That hidden
          masterful Something, for which we long have no name until at last
          it shows itself as our task—that tyrant in us exacts a terrible
          price for every attempt that we make to escape him or give him the

          reconciliation with those to whom we do not belong, for every

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was then that
          I learnt the hermitical habit of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg007"></a> speech acquired only by the most silent and
          suffering. I spoke without witnesses, or rather indifferent to the
          presence of witnesses, so as not to suffer from silence, I spoke of
          various things that did not concern me in a style that gave the
          impression that they did. Then, too, I learnt the art of showing
          myself cheerful, objective, inquisitive in the presence of all that
          is healthy and evil—is this, in an invalid, as it seems to me, his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“good taste”</span>? Nevertheless, a more
          subtle eye and sympathy will not miss what perhaps gives a charm to
          these writings—the fact that here speaks one who has suffered and
          abstained in such a way as if he had never suffered or abstained.
          Here equipoise, composure, even gratitude towards life <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shall</span></em>
          be maintained, here rules a stern, proud, ever vigilant, ever
          susceptible will, which has undertaken the task of defending life
          against pain and snapping off all conclusions that are wont to grow
          like poisonous fungi from pain, disappointment, satiety, isolation
          and other morasses. Perhaps this gives our pessimists a hint to
          self-examination? For it was then that I hit upon the aphorism,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a sufferer has as yet no right to
          pessimism,”</span> and that I engaged in a tedious, patient
          campaign against the unscientific first principles of all romantic
          pessimism, which seeks to magnify and interpret individual,
          personal experiences into <span class="tei tei-q">“general
          judgments,”</span> universal condemnations—it was then, in short,
          that I sighted a new world. Optimism for the sake of restitution,
          in order at some time to have the right to become a pessimist—do
          you understand that? Just as a physician transfers his patient to
          totally strange surroundings, in order to displace <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg008"></a> him from his entire <span class="tei tei-q">“past,”</span> his troubles, friends, letters, duties,
          stupid mistakes and painful memories, and teaches him to stretch
          out hands and senses towards new nourishment, a new sun, a new
          future: so I, as physician and invalid in one, forced myself into
          an utterly different and untried zone of the soul, and particularly
          into an absorbing journey to a strange land, a strange atmosphere,
          into a curiosity for all that was strange. A long process of
          roaming, seeking, changing followed, a distaste for fixity of any
          kind—a dislike for clumsy affirmation and negation: and at the same
          time a dietary and discipline which aimed at making it as easy as
          possible for the soul to fly high, and above all constantly to fly
          away. In fact a minimum of life, an unfettering from all coarser
          forms of sensuality, an independence in the midst of all marks of
          outward disfavour, together with the pride in being able to live in
          the midst of all this disfavour: a little cynicism perhaps, a
          little of the <span class="tei tei-q">“tub of Diogenes,”</span> a
          good deal of whimsical happiness, whimsical gaiety, much calm,
          light, subtle folly, hidden enthusiasm—all this produced in the end
          a great spiritual strengthening, a growing joy and exuberance of
          health. Life itself rewards us for our tenacious will to life, for
          such a long war as I waged against the pessimistic weariness of
          life, even for every observant glance of our gratitude, glances
          that do not miss the smallest, most delicate, most fugitive
          gifts.... In the end we receive Life's great gifts, perhaps the
          greatest it can bestow—we regain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em>

          men (moralists), by taking them over without qualification and
          trying to prove as necessary what the moralists only meant as a
          rough indication or as a truth suited to their fellow-countrymen or
          fellow-townsmen for a single decade. Moreover, the philosophers
          thought that they were thereby raising themselves above the
          moralists! Thus it will be found that the celebrated teachings of
          Schopenhauer as to the supremacy of the will over the intellect, of
          the immutability of character, the negativity of pleasure—all
          errors, in the sense in which he understands them—rest upon
          principles of popular wisdom enunciated by the moralists. Take the
          very word <span class="tei tei-q">“will,”</span> which Schopenhauer
          twisted so as to become a common denotation of several human
          conditions and with which he filled a gap in the language (to his
          own great advantage, in so far as he was a moralist, for he became
          free to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg
          015]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg015"></a>
          speak of the will as Pascal had spoken of it). In the hands of its
          creator, Schopenhauer's <span class="tei tei-q">“will,”</span>
          through the philosophic craze for generalisation, already turned
          out to be a bane to knowledge. For this will was made into a poetic
          metaphor, when it was held that all things in nature possess will.
          Finally, that it might be applied to all kinds of disordered
          mysticism, the word was misused by a fraudulent convention. So now
          all our fashionable philosophers repeat it and seem to be perfectly
          certain that all things have a will and are in fact One Will.
          According to the description generally given of this All-One-Will,
          this is much as if one should positively try to have the stupid
          Devil for one's God.</p>

          Intimate Experience of the Thinker.</span></span>—Nothing is harder
          for a man than to conceive of an object impersonally, I mean to see
          in it an object and not a person. One may even ask whether it is
          possible for him to dispense for a single moment with the machinery
          of his instinct to create and construct a personality. After all,
          he associates with his thoughts, however abstract they may be, as
          with individuals, against whom he must fight or to whom he must
          attach himself, whom he must protect, support and nourish. Let us
          watch or listen to ourselves at the moment when we hear or discover
          a new idea. Perhaps it displeases us because it is so defiant and
          so autocratic, and we unconsciously ask ourselves whether we cannot
          place a contradiction of it by its side as an enemy, or fasten on
          to it a <span class="tei tei-q">“perhaps”</span> or a <span class="tei tei-q">“sometimes”</span>: the mere little word <span class="tei tei-q">“probably”</span> gives us a feeling of satisfaction,
          for it shatters the oppressive tyranny of the unconditional. If, on
          the other hand, the new idea enters in gentle shape, sweetly
          patient and humble, and falling at once into the arms of
          contradiction, we put our autocracy to the test in another way. Can
          we not come to the aid of this weak creature, stroke it and feed
          it, give it strength and fulness, and truth and even
          unconditionality? Is it possible for us to show ourselves parental
          or chivalrous or compassionate towards our idea?—Then again, we see
          here a judgment and there a judgment, sundered from each other,
          never looking at or making any movement <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg023"></a> towards each other. So we are tickled by the
          thought, whether it be not here feasible to make a match, to draw a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conclusion</span></em>, with the anticipation
          that if a consequence follows this conclusion it is not only the
          two judgments united in wedlock but the matchmakers that will gain
          honour. If, however, we cannot acquire a hold upon that thought
          either on the path of defiance and ill-will or on that of good-will
          (if we hold it to be true)—then we submit to it and do homage to it
          as a leader and a prince, give it a chair of honour, and speak not
          of it without a flourish of trumpets: for we are bright in its
          brightness. Woe to him who tries to dim this brightness! Perhaps we
          ourselves one day grow suspicious of our idea. Then we, the
          indefatigable <span class="tei tei-q">“king-makers”</span> of the
          history of the intellect, cast it down from its throne and
          immediately exalt its adversary. Surely if this be considered and
          thought out a little further, no one will speak of an <span class="tei tei-q">“absolute impulse to knowledge”</span>!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Why, then, does
          man prefer the true to the untrue, in this secret combat with
          thought-personalities, in this generally clandestine match-making
          of thoughts, constitution-founding of thoughts, child-rearing of
          thoughts, nursing and almsgiving of thoughts? For the same reason
          that he practises honesty in intercourse with real persons:
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em> from habit, heredity, and
          training, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">originally</span></em> because the true, like
          the fair and the just, is more expedient and more reputable than
          the untrue. For in the realm of thought it is difficult to assume a
          power and glory that are built on error or on falsehood. The
          feeling that such an edifice might at some time collapse is
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg024"></a> humiliating to the
          self-esteem of the architect—he is ashamed of the fragility of the
          material, and, as he considers himself more important than the rest
          of the world, he would fain construct nothing that is less durable
          than the rest of the world. In his longing for truth he embraces
          the belief in a personal immortality, the most arrogant and defiant
          idea that exists, closely allied as it is to the underlying
          thought, <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pereat mundus, dum ego salvus
          sim!</span></span> His work has become his <span class="tei tei-q">“ego,”</span> he transforms himself into the
          Imperishable with its universal challenge. It is his immeasurable
          pride that will only employ the best and hardest stones for the
          work—truths, or what he holds for such. Arrogance has always been
          justly called the <span class="tei tei-q">“vice of the
          sage”</span>; yet without this vice, fruitful in impulses, Truth
          and her status on earth would be in a parlous plight. In our
          propensity to fear our thoughts, concepts and words, and yet to
          honour ourselves in them, unconsciously to ascribe to them the
          power of rewarding, despising, praising, and blaming us, and so to
          associate with them as with free intellectual personalities, as
          with independent powers, as with our equals—herein lie the roots of
          the remarkable phenomenon which I have called <span class="tei tei-q">“intellectual conscience.”</span> Thus something of the
          highest moral species has bloomed from a black root.</p>

          profound understanding of what is human and all-too-human and
          original sense for facts was not a little impaired by the bright
          leopard-skin of his metaphysic (the skin must first be pulled off
          him if one wants to find the real moralist genius
          beneath)—Schopenhauer makes this admirable distinction, wherein he
          comes far nearer the mark than he would himself dare to admit:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Insight into the stern necessity of human
          actions is the boundary line that divides philosophic from other
          brains.”</span> He worked against that wonderful insight of which
          he was sometimes capable by the prejudice that he had in common
          with the moral man (not the moralist), a prejudice that he
          expresses quite guilelessly and devoutly as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg029"></a> follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          ultimate and true explanation of the inner being of the entirety of
          things must of necessity be closely connected with that about the
          ethical significance of human actions.”</span> This connection is
          not <span class="tei tei-q">“necessary”</span> at all: such a
          connection must rather be rejected by that principle of the stern
          necessity of human actions, that is, the unconditioned non-freedom
          and non-responsibility of the will. Philosophic brains will
          accordingly be distinguished from others by their disbelief in the
          metaphysical significance of morality. This must create between the
          two kinds of brain a gulf of a depth and unbridgeableness of which
          the much-deplored gulf between <span class="tei tei-q">“cultured”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“uncultured”</span> scarcely gives a conception. It is
          true that many back doors, which the <span class="tei tei-q">“philosophic brains,”</span> like Schopenhauer's own,
          have left for themselves, must be recognised as useless. None leads
          into the open, into the fresh air of the free will, but every door
          through which people had slipped hitherto showed behind it once
          more the gleaming brass wall of fate. For we are in a prison, and
          can only dream of freedom, not make ourselves free. That the
          recognition of this fact cannot be resisted much longer is shown by
          the despairing and incredible postures and grimaces of those who
          still press against it and continue their wrestling-bout with it.
          Their attitude at present is something like this: <span class="tei tei-q">“So no one is responsible for his actions? And all is
          full of guilt and the consciousness of guilt? But some one
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> be the sinner. If it is no
          longer possible or permissible to accuse and sentence the
          individual, the one poor wave in the inevitable rough-and-tumble of
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg030"></a> waves of
          development—well, then, let this stormy sea, this development
          itself, be the sinner. Here is free will: this totality can be
          accused and sentenced, can atone and expiate. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">So let God be the
          sinner and man his redeemer.</span></em> Let the world's history be
          guilt, expiation, and self-murder. Let the evil-doer be his own
          judge, the judge his own hangman.”</span> This Christianity
          strained to its limits—for what else is it?—is the last thrust in
          the fencing-match between the teaching of unconditioned morality
          and the teaching of unconditioned non-freedom. It would be quite
          horrible if it were anything more than a logical pose, a hideous
          grimace of the underlying thought, perhaps the death-convulsion of
          the heart that seeks a remedy in its despair, the heart to which
          delirium whispers: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, thou art the
          lamb which taketh away the sin of God.”</span> This error lies not
          only in the feeling, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
          responsible,”</span> but just as much in the contradiction,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not responsible, but some one must
          be.”</span> That is simply not true. Hence the philosopher must
          say, like Christ, <span class="tei tei-q">“Judge not,”</span> and
          the final distinction between the philosophic brains and the others
          would be that the former wish to be just and the latter wish to be
          judges.</p>

          death during the prime of his life and strength is very expressive
          and significant for what we call his character. But the hour of
          death itself, his behaviour on the death-bed, is almost
          indifferent. The exhaustion of waning life, especially when old
          people die, the irregular or insufficient nourishment of the brain
          during this last period, the occasionally violent pain, the novel
          and untried nature of the whole position, and only too often the
          ebb and flow of superstitious impressions and fears, as if dying
          were of much consequence and meant the crossing of bridges of the
          most terrible kind—all this forbids our using death as a testimony
          concerning the living. Nor is it true that the dying man is
          generally more honest than the living. On the contrary, through the
          solemn attitude of the bystanders, the repressed or flowing streams
          of tears and emotions, every one is inveigled into a comedy of
          vanity, now conscious, now unconscious. The serious way in which
          every dying man is treated must have been to many a poor despised
          devil the highest joy of his whole life and a sort of compensation
          and repayment for many privations.</p>

          to two ideas: <span class="tei tei-q">“The community <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg047"></a> is of more value than the
          individual,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“The permanent
          interest is to be preferred to the temporary.”</span> The
          conclusion drawn is that the permanent interest of the community is
          unconditionally to be set above the temporary interest of the
          individual, especially his momentary well-being, but also his
          permanent interest and even the prolongation of his existence. Even
          if the individual suffers by an arrangement that suits the mass,
          even if he is depressed and ruined by it, morality must be
          maintained and the victim brought to the sacrifice. Such a trend of
          thought arises, however, only in those who are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> the
          victims—for in the victim's case it enforces the claim that the
          individual might be worth more than the many, and that the present

          perhaps be rated higher than a tame succession of untroubled or
          comfortable circumstances. But the philosophy of the sacrificial
          victim always finds voice too late, and so victory remains with
          morals and morality: which are really nothing more than the
          sentiment for the whole concept of morals under which one lives and
          has been reared—and reared not as an individual but as a member of
          the whole, as a cipher in a majority. Hence it constantly happens
          that the individual makes himself into a majority by means of his

          only demand of man, his creation and his image, what it is possible
          for man to fulfil, and accordingly that Christian virtue and
          perfection are attainable and often attained. Now, for instance,
          the belief in loving one's enemies—even if it is only a belief or
          fancy, and by no means a psychological reality (a real love)—gives
          unalloyed happiness, so long as it is genuinely believed. (As to
          the reason of this, psychologist and Christian might well differ.)
          Hence earthly life, through the belief, I mean the fancy, that it
          satisfies not only the injunction to love our enemies, but all the
          other injunctions of Christianity, and that it has really
          assimilated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg

          conjecture as to the disappearance of Christianity and as to the
          places where it will be the slowest to retreat, if we consider
          where and for what reasons Protestantism spread with such startling
          rapidity. As is well known, Protestantism promised to do far more
          cheaply all that the old Church did, without costly masses,
          pilgrimages, and priestly pomp and circumstance. It spread
          particularly among the Northern nations, which were not so deeply
          rooted as those of the South in the old Church's symbolism and love
          of ritual. In the South the more powerful pagan religion survived
          in Christianity, whereas in the North Christianity meant an
          opposition to and a break with the old-time creed, and hence was
          from the first more thoughtful and less sensual, but for that very
          reason, in times of peril, more fanatical and more obstinate. If
          from the standpoint of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span></em> we succeed in uprooting
          Christianity, we can at once know the point where it will begin to
          disappear—the very point at which it will be most stubborn in
          defence. In other places it will bend but not break, lose its
          leaves but burst into leaf afresh, because the senses, and not
          thought, have gone over to its side. But it is the senses
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg052"></a> that maintain the
          belief that with all its expensive outlay the Church is more
          cheaply and conveniently managed than under the stern conditions of
          work and wages. Yet what does one hold leisure (or semi-idleness)
          to be worth, when once one has become accustomed to it? The senses
          plead against a dechristianised world, saying that there would be
          too much work to do in it and an insufficient supply of leisure.

          religion demand more self-denial and draw the selfish out of
          themselves more inexorably than science?—This and similar things we
          may say, in any case with a certain theatricality, when we have to
          defend ourselves against believers, for it is impossible to conduct
          a defence without a certain amount of theatricality. But between
          ourselves our language must be more honest, and we employ a freedom
          that those believers are not even allowed, in their own interests,
          to understand. Away, then, with the monastic cowl of self-denial,
          with the appearance of humility! Much more and much better—so rings
          our truth! If science were not linked with the pleasure of
          knowledge, the utility of the thing known, what should we care for
          science? If a little faith, love, and hope did not lead our souls
          to knowledge, what would attract us to science? And if in science
          the ego means nothing, still the inventive, happy ego, every
          upright and industrious ego, means a great deal in the republic of
          the men of science. The homage of those who pay homage, the joy of
          those whom we wish well or honour, in some cases glory and a fair
          share of immortality, is the personal reward for every suppression
          of personality: to say nothing here of meaner views and rewards,
          although it is just on this account that the majority have sworn
          and always continue to swear fidelity to the laws of the republic
          and of science. If we had not remained in some degree unscientific,
          what would science matter to us? Taking everything together and

          language: <span class="tei tei-q">“To a purely knowing being
          knowledge would be indifferent.”</span>—Not the quality but the
          quantity of faith and devoutness distinguishes us from the pious,
          the believers. We are content with less. But should one of them cry
          out to us: <span class="tei tei-q">“Be content and show yourselves
          contented!”</span> we could easily answer: <span class="tei tei-q">“As a matter of fact, we do not belong to the most

          poets portrayed the images of the Gods, portray the fair images of
          men. He will divine those cases where, in the midst of our modern
          world and reality (which will not be shirked or repudiated in the
          usual poetic fashion), a great, noble soul is still possible, where
          it may be embodied in harmonious, equable conditions, where it may
          become permanent, visible, and representative of a type, and so, by
          the stimulus to imitation and envy, help to create the future. The
          poems of such a poet would be distinguished by appearing secluded
          and protected from the heated atmosphere of the passions. The
          irremediable failure, the shattering of all the strings of the
          human instrument, the scornful laughter and gnashing of teeth, and
          all tragedy and comedy in the usual old sense, would appear by the
          side of this new art as mere archaic lumber, a blurring of the
          outlines of the world-picture. Strength, kindness, gentleness,
          purity, and an unsought, innate moderation in the personalities and
          their action: a levelled soil, giving rest and pleasure to the
          foot: a shining heaven mirrored in faces and events: science and
          art welded into a new unity: the mind living together with her
          sister, the soul, without arrogance or jealousy, and enticing from
          contrasts the grace of seriousness, not the impatience of
          discord—all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg
          056]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg056"></a>
          this would be the general environment, the background on which the
          delicate differences of the embodied ideals would make the real
          picture, that of ever-growing human majesty. Many roads to this
          poetry of the future start from Goethe, but the quest needs good
          pathfinders and above all a far greater strength than is possessed
          by modern poets, who unscrupulously represent the half-animal and
          the immaturity and intemperance that are mistaken by them for power
          and naturalness.</p>

          Writer.</span></span>—In a book for free spirits one cannot avoid
          mention of Laurence Sterne, the man whom Goethe honoured as the
          freest spirit of his century. May he be satisfied with the honour
          of being called the freest writer of all times, in comparison with
          whom all others appear stiff, square-toed, intolerant, and
          downright boorish! In his case we should not speak of the clear and
          rounded but of <span class="tei tei-q">“the endless
          melody”</span>—if by this phrase we arrive at a name for an
          artistic style in which the definite form is continually broken,
          thrust aside and transferred to the realm of the indefinite, so
          that it signifies one and the other at the same time. Sterne is the
          great master of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">double entendre</span></span>, this phrase
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg061"></a> being naturally used
          in a far wider sense than is commonly done when one applies it to
          sexual relations. We may give up for lost the reader who always
          wants to know exactly what Sterne thinks about a matter, and
          whether he be making a serious or a smiling face (for he can do
          both with one wrinkling of his features; he can be and even wishes
          to be right and wrong at the same moment, to interweave profundity
          and farce). His digressions are at once continuations and further
          developments of the story, his maxims contain a satire on all that
          is sententious, his dislike of seriousness is bound up with a
          disposition to take no matter merely externally and on the surface.
          So in the proper reader he arouses a feeling of uncertainty whether
          he be walking, lying, or standing, a feeling most closely akin to
          that of floating in the air. He, the most versatile of writers,
          communicates something of this versatility to his reader. Yes,
          Sterne unexpectedly changes the parts, and is often as much reader
          as author, his book being like a play within a play, a theatre
          audience before another theatre audience. We must surrender at
          discretion to the mood of Sterne, although we can always expect it
          to be gracious. It is strangely instructive to see how so great a
          writer as Diderot has affected this <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">double
          entendre</span></span> of Sterne's—to be equally ambiguous
          throughout is just the Sternian super-humour. Did Diderot imitate,
          admire, ridicule, or parody Sterne in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jacques le
          Fataliste</span></span>? One cannot be exactly certain, and this
          uncertainty was perhaps intended by the author. This very doubt
          makes the French unjust to the work of one of their first masters,
          one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg062"></a> who need not be
          ashamed of comparison with any of the ancients or moderns. For
          humour (and especially for this humorous attitude towards humour
          itself) the French are too serious. Is it necessary to add that of
          all great authors Sterne is the worst model, in fact the inimitable
          author, and that even Diderot had to pay for his daring? What the
          worthy Frenchmen and before them some Greeks and Romans aimed at
          and attained in prose is the very opposite of what Sterne aims at
          and attains. He raises himself as a masterly exception above all
          that artists in writing demand of themselves—propriety, reserve,
          character, steadfastness of purpose, comprehensiveness,
          perspicuity, good deportment in gait and feature. Unfortunately
          Sterne the man seems to have been only too closely related to
          Sterne the writer. His squirrel-soul sprang with insatiable unrest
          from branch to branch; he knew what lies between sublimity and
          rascality; he had sat on every seat, always with unabashed watery
          eyes and mobile play of feature. He was—if language does not revolt
          from such a combination—of a hard-hearted kindness, and in the
          midst of the joys of a grotesque and even corrupt imagination he
          showed the bashful grace of innocence. Such a carnal and spiritual
          hermaphroditism, such untrammelled wit penetrating into every vein
          and muscle, was perhaps never possessed by any other man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Origins of
          Taste in Works of Art.</span></span>—If we consider the primary
          germs of the artistic sense, and ask ourselves what are the various
          kinds of joy produced by the firstlings of art—as, for example,
          among savage tribes—we find first of all the joy of understanding
          what another means. Art in this case is a sort of conundrum, which
          causes its solver pleasure in his own quick and keen
          perceptions.—Then the roughest works of art remind us of the
          pleasant things we have actually experienced, and so give joy—as,
          for example, when the artist alludes to a chase, a victory, a
          wedding.—Again, the representation may cause us to feel excited,
          touched, inflamed, as for instance in the glorification of revenge
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg065"></a> and danger. Here the
          enjoyment lies in the excitement itself, in the victory over
          tedium.—The memory, too, of unpleasant things, so far as they have
          been overcome or make us appear interesting to the listener as
          subjects for art (as when the singer describes the mishaps of a
          daring seaman), can inspire great joy, the credit for which is
          given to art.—A more subtle variety is the joy that arises at the
          sight of all that is regular and symmetrical in lines, points, and
          rhythms. For by a certain analogy is awakened the feeling for all
          that is orderly and regular in life, which one has to thank alone
          for all well-being. So in the cult of symmetry we unconsciously do
          homage to rule and proportion as the source of our previous
          happiness, and the joy in this case is a kind of hymn of
          thanksgiving. Only when a certain satiety of the last-mentioned joy
          arises does a more subtle feeling step in, that enjoyment might
          even lie in a violation of the symmetrical and regular. This
          feeling, for example, impels us to seek reason in apparent
          unreason, and the sort of æsthetic riddle-guessing that results is
          in a way the higher species of the first-named artistic joy.—He who
          pursues this speculation still further will know what kind of
          hypotheses for the explanation of æsthetic phenomena are hereby
          fundamentally rejected.</p>

          more lively, delicate, energetic, and passionate states, the later
          masters, spoilt by these means of expression, do not feel at their
          ease in the presence of the old-time works of art. They feel as if
          the ancients had merely been lacking in the means of making their
          souls speak clearly, also perhaps in some necessary technical
          preliminaries. They think that they must render some assistance in
          this quarter, for they believe in the similarity or even unity of
          all souls. In truth, however, measure, symmetry, a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg068"></a> contempt for graciousness and charm, an
          unconscious severity and morning chilliness, an evasion of passion,
          as if passion meant the death of art—such are the constituents of
          sentiment and morality in all old masters, who selected and
          arranged their means of expression not at random but in a necessary
          connection with their morality. Knowing this, are we to deny those
          that come after the right to animate the older works with their
          soul? No, for these works can only survive through our giving them
          our soul, and our blood alone enables them to speak to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">us</span></em>. The
          real <span class="tei tei-q">“historic”</span> discourse would talk
          ghostly speech to ghosts. We honour the great artists less by that
          barren timidity that allows every word, every note to remain intact
          than by energetic endeavours to aid them continually to a new
          life.—True, if Beethoven were suddenly to come to life and hear one
          of his works performed with that modern animation and nervous
          refinement that bring glory to our masters of execution, he would
          probably be silent for a long while, uncertain whether he should
          raise his hand to curse or to bless, but perhaps say at last:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, well! That is neither I nor not-I,
          but a third thing—it seems to me, too, something right, if not just

          element. One has to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">swim</span></em>. In the previous, older music
          one was forced, with delicate or stately or impassioned movement,
          to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dance</span></em>. The measure necessary for
          dancing, the observance of a distinct balance of time and force in
          the soul of the hearer, imposed a continual self-control. Through
          the counteraction of the cooler draught of air which came from this
          caution and the warmer breath of musical enthusiasm, that music
          exercised its spell.—Richard Wagner aimed at a different excitation
          of the soul, allied, as above said, to swimming and floating. This
          is perhaps the most essential of his innovations. His famous
          method, originating from this aim and adapted to it—the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“endless melody”</span>—strives to break
          and sometimes even to despise all mathematical equilibrium of time
          and force. He is only too rich in the invention of such effects,
          which sound to the old school like rhythmic paradoxes and
          blasphemies. He dreads petrifaction, crystallisation, the
          development of music into the architectural. He accordingly sets up
          a three-time rhythm in opposition to the double-time, not
          infrequently introduces five-time and seven-time, immediately
          repeats a phrase, but with a prolation, so that its time is again
          doubled and trebled. From an easy-going imitation of such art may
          arise a great danger to music, for by the side of the
          superabundance of rhythmic emotion demoralisation and decadence
          lurk in ambush. The danger will become very great if such music

          as thinker and writer is not born or trained to dialectic and the
          consecutive arrangement of ideas, will unconsciously turn to the
          rhetoric and dramatic forms. For, after all, his object is to make
          himself understood and to carry the day by force, and he is
          indifferent whether, as shepherd, he honestly guides to himself the
          hearts of his fellow-men, or, as robber, he captures them by
          surprise. This is true of the plastic arts as of music: where the
          feeling of insufficient dialectic or a deficiency in expression or
          narration, together with an urgent, over-powerful impulse to form,
          gives birth to that species of style known as <span class="tei tei-q">“baroque.”</span> Only the ill-educated and the
          arrogant will at once find a depreciatory force in this word. The
          baroque style always arises at the time of decay of a great art,
          when the demands of art in classical expression have become too
          great. It is a natural phenomenon which will be observed with
          melancholy—for it is a forerunner of the night—but at the same time
          with admiration for its peculiar compensatory arts of expression
          and narration. To this style belongs already a choice of material
          and subjects of the highest dramatic tension, at which the heart
          trembles even when there is no art, because heaven and hell are all
          too near the emotions: then, the oratory of strong passion and
          gestures, of ugly sublimity, of great <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg075"></a> masses, in fact of absolute quantity
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per
          se</span></span> (as is shown in Michael Angelo, the father or
          grandfather of the Italian baroque stylists): the lights of dusk,
          illumination and conflagration playing upon those strongly moulded
          forms: ever-new ventures in means and aims, strongly underscored by
          artists for artists, while the layman must fancy he sees an
          unconscious overflowing of all the horns of plenty of an original
          nature-art: all these characteristics that constitute the greatness
          of that style are neither possible nor permitted in the earlier
          ante-classical and classical periods of a branch of art. Such
          luxuries hang long on the tree like forbidden fruit. Just now, when
          music is passing into this last phase, we may learn to know the
          phenomenon of the baroque style in peculiar splendour, and, by
          comparison, find much that is instructive for earlier ages. For
          from Greek times onward there has often been a baroque style, in
          poetry, oratory, prose writing, sculpture, and, as is well known,
          in architecture. This style, though wanting in the highest
          nobility,—the nobility of an innocent, unconscious, triumphant
          perfection,—has nevertheless given pleasure to many of the best and
          most serious minds of their time. Hence, as aforesaid, it is
          presumptuous to depreciate it without reserve, however happy we may
          feel because our taste for it has not made us insensible to the
          purer and greater style.</p>

          what can be called art-need, but it is small, and can be cheaply
          satisfied. On the whole, the remnant of art (it must be honestly
          confessed) suffices for this need. Let us consider, for example,
          the kind of melodies and songs in which the most vigorous,
          unspoiled, and true-hearted classes of the population find genuine
          delight; let us live among shepherds, cowherds, peasants, huntsmen,
          soldiers, and sailors, and give ourselves the answer. And in the
          country town, just in the houses that are the homes of inherited
          civic virtue, is it not the worst music at present produced
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg084"></a> that is loved and,
          one might say, cherished? He who speaks of deeper needs and
          unsatisfied yearnings for art among the people, as it is, is a
          crank or an impostor. Be honest! Only in exceptional men is there
          now an art-need in the highest sense—because art is once more on
          the down-grade, and human powers and hopes are for the time being
          directed to other matters.—Apart from this, outside the populace,
          there exists indeed, in the higher and highest strata of society, a
          broader and more comprehensive art-need, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of the second
          order</span></em>. Here there is a sort of artistic commune, which
          possibly means to be sincere. But let us look at the elements! They
          are in general the more refined malcontents, who attain no genuine
          pleasure in themselves; the cultured, who have not become free
          enough to dispense with the consolations of religion, and yet do
          not find its incense sufficiently fragrant; the half-aristocratic,
          who are too weak to combat by a heroic conversion or renunciation
          the one fundamental error of their lives or the pernicious bent of
          their characters; the highly gifted, who think themselves too
          dignified to be of service by modest activity, and are too lazy for
          real, self-sacrificing work; girls who cannot create for themselves
          a satisfactory sphere of duties; women who have tied themselves by
          a light-hearted or nefarious marriage, and know that they are not
          tied securely enough; scholars, physicians, merchants, officials
          who specialised too early and never gave their lives a free enough
          scope—who do their work efficiently, it is true, but with a worm
          gnawing at their hearts; finally, all imperfect artists—these are
          nowadays the true needers of art! <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg085"></a> What do they really desire from art? Art is
          to drive away hours and moments of discomfort, boredom, half-bad
          conscience, and, if possible, transform the faults of their lives
          and characters into faults of world-destiny. Very different were
          the Greeks, who realised in their art the outflow and overflow of
          their own sense of well-being and health, and loved to see their
          perfection once more from a standpoint outside themselves. They
          were led to art by delight in themselves; our contemporaries—by
          disgust of themselves.</p>

          the Theatre.</span></span>—The real theatrical talent of the
          Germans was Kotzebue. He and his Germans, those of higher as well
          as those of middle-class society, were necessarily associated, and
          his contemporaries should have said of him in all seriousness,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in him we live and move and have our
          being.”</span> Here was nothing—no constraint, pretence, or
          half-enjoyment: what he could and would do was understood. Yes,
          until now the honest theatrical success on the German stage has
          been in the hands of the shamefaced or unashamed heirs of
          Kotzebue's methods and influence—that is, as far as comedy still
          flourishes at all. The result is that much of the Germanism of that
          age, sometimes far off from the great towns, still survives.
          Good-natured; incontinent in small pleasures; always ready for
          tears; with the desire, in the theatre at any rate, to be able to
          get rid of their innate sobriety and strict attention to duty and
          exercise; a smiling, nay, a laughing indulgence; confusing goodness
          and sympathy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg
          086]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg086"></a>
          and welding them into one, as is the essential characteristic of
          German sentimentality; exceedingly happy at a noble, magnanimous
          action; for the rest, submissive towards superiors, envious of each
          other, and yet in their heart of hearts thoroughly
          self-satisfied—such were they and such was he.—The second dramatic
          talent was Schiller. He discovered a class of hearers which had
          hitherto never been taken into consideration: among the callow
          German youth of both sexes. His poetry responded to their higher,
          nobler, more violent if more confused emotions, their delight in
          the jingle of moral words (a delight that begins to disappear when
          we reach the thirties). Thus he won for himself, by virtue of the
          passionateness and partisanship of the young, a success which
          gradually reacted with advantage upon those of riper years.
          Generally speaking, Schiller rejuvenated the Germans. Goethe stood
          and still stands above the Germans in every respect. To them he
          will never belong. How could a nation in well-being and
          well-wishing come up to the intellectuality of Goethe? Beethoven
          composed and Schopenhauer philosophised above the heads of the
          Germans, and it was above their heads, in the same way, that Goethe
          wrote his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tasso</span></span>, his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iphigenie</span></span>. He was followed by a
          small company of highly cultured persons, who were educated by
          antiquity, life, and travel, and had grown out of German ways of
          thought. He himself did not wish it to be otherwise.—When the
          Romantics set up their well-conceived Goethe cult; when their
          amazing skill in appreciation was passed on to the disciples of
          Hegel, the real educators of the Germans <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg087"></a> of this century; when the awakening national
          ambition turned out advantageous to the fame of the German poets;
          when the real standard of the nation, as to whether it could
          honestly find enjoyment in anything, became inexorably subordinated
          to the judgment of individuals and to that national ambition,—that
          is, when people began to enjoy by compulsion,—then arose that
          false, spurious German culture which was ashamed of Kotzebue; which
          brought Sophocles, Calderon, and even the Second Part of Goethe's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Faust</span></span> on the stage; and which,
          on account of its foul tongue and congested stomach, no longer
          knows now what it likes and what it finds tedious.—Happy are those
          who have taste, even if it be a bad taste! Only by this
          characteristic can one be wise as well as happy. Hence the Greeks,
          who were very refined in such matters, designated the sage by a
          word that means <span class="tei tei-q">“man of taste,”</span> and
          called wisdom, artistic as well as scientific, <span class="tei tei-q">“taste”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sophia</span></span>).</p>

          Late-Comer in every Culture.</span></span>—Among all the arts that
          are accustomed to grow on a definite culture-soil and under
          definite social and political conditions, music is the last plant
          to come up, arising in the autumn and fading-season of the culture
          to which it belongs. At the same time, the first signs and
          harbingers of a new spring are usually already noticeable, and
          sometimes music, like the language of a forgotten age, rings out
          into a new, astonished world, and comes too late. In the art of the
          Dutch and Flemish musicians the soul <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg088"></a> of the Christian middle ages at last found
          its fullest tone: their sound-architecture is the posthumous but
          legitimate and equal sister of Gothic. Not until Handel's music was
          heard the note of the best in the soul of Luther and his kin, the
          great Judæo-heroical impulse that created the whole Reformation
          movement. Mozart first expressed in golden melody the age of Louis
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">xiv.</span></span> and the art of Racine
          and Claude Lorrain. The eighteenth century—that century of
          rhapsody, of broken ideals and transitory happiness—only sang
          itself out in the music of Beethoven and Rossini. A lover of
          sentimental similes might say that all really important music was a
          swan-song.—Music is, in fact, not a universal language for all
          time, as is so often said in its praise, but responds exactly to a
          particular period and warmth of emotion which involves a quite
          definite, individual culture, determined by time and place, as its
          inner law. The music of Palestrina would be quite unintelligible to
          a Greek; and again, what would the music of Rossini convey to
          Palestrina?—It may be that our most modern German music, with all
          its pre-eminence and desire of pre-eminence, will soon be no longer
          understood. For this music sprang from a culture that is undergoing
          a rapid decay, from the soil of that epoch of reaction and
          restoration in which a certain Catholicism of feeling, as well as a
          delight in all indigenous, national, primitive manners, burst into
          bloom and scattered a blended perfume over Europe. These two
          emotional tendencies, adopted in their greatest strength and
          carried to their farthest limits, found final expression in the
          music of Wagner. Wagner's predilection for the old <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg089"></a> native sagas, his free idealisation of
          their unfamiliar gods and heroes,—who are really sovereign beasts
          of prey with occasional fits of thoughtfulness, magnanimity, and
          boredom,—his re-animation of those figures, to which he gave in
          addition the mediæval Christian thirst for ecstatic sensuality and
          spiritualisation—all this Wagnerian give-and-take with regard to
          materials, souls, figures, and words—would clearly express the
          spirit of his music, if it could not, like all music, speak quite
          unambiguously of itself. This spirit wages the last campaign of
          reaction against the spirit of illumination which passed into this
          century from the last, and also against the super-national ideas of
          French revolutionary romanticism and of English and American
          insipidity in the reconstruction of state and society.—But is it
          not evident that the spheres of thought and emotion apparently
          suppressed by Wagner and his school have long since acquired fresh
          strength, and that his late musical protest against them generally
          rings into ears that prefer to hear different and opposite notes;
          so that one day that high and wonderful art will suddenly become
          unintelligible and will be covered by the spider's web of
          oblivion?—In considering this state of affairs we must not let
          ourselves be led astray by those transitory fluctuations which
          arise like a reaction within a reaction, as a temporary sinking of
          the mountainous wave in the midst of the general upheaval. Thus,
          this decade of national war, ultramontane martyrdom, and
          socialistic unrest may, in its remoter after-effect, even aid the
          Wagnerian art to acquire a sudden halo, without guaranteeing that
          it <span class="tei tei-q">“has a future”</span> or that it

          longer a Teacher.</span></span>—Strange as it may sound to our
          time, there were once poets and artists whose soul was above the
          passions with their delights and convulsions, and who therefore
          took their pleasure in purer materials, worthier men, more delicate
          complications and dénouements. If the artists of our day for the
          most part unfetter the will, and so are under certain circumstances
          for that very reason emancipators of life, those were tamers of the
          will, enchanters of animals, creators of men. In fact, they
          moulded, re-moulded, and new-moulded life, whereas the fame of
          poets of our day lies in unharnessing, unchaining, and
          shattering.—The ancient Greeks demanded of the poet that he should
          be the teacher of grown men. How ashamed the poet would be now if
          this demand were made of him! He is not even a good student of
          himself, and so never himself becomes a good poem or a fine
          picture. Under the most favourable circumstances he remains the
          shy, attractive ruin of a temple, but at the same time a cavern of
          cravings, overgrown like a ruin with flowers, nettles, and
          poisonous weeds, inhabited and haunted by snakes, worms, spiders,
          and birds; an object for sad reflection as to why the noblest and
          most precious must grow up at once <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg091"></a> like a ruin, without the past and future of

          nature of the case that for certain periods of life an art of
          overstrain, excitement, antipathy to the orderly, monotonous,
          simple, logical, is an inevitable need, to which artists must
          respond, lest the soul of such periods should unburden itself in
          other ways, through all kinds of disorder and impropriety. Hence
          youths as they generally are, full, fermenting, tortured above all
          things by boredom, and women who lack work that fully occupies

          meant to embellish life, to make us ourselves endurable and if
          possible agreeable in the eyes of others. With this task in view,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg092"></a> art moderates us and
          holds us in restraint, creates forms of intercourse, binds over the
          uneducated to laws of decency, cleanliness, politeness, well-timed
          speech and silence. Hence art must conceal or transfigure
          everything that is ugly—the painful, terrible, and disgusting
          elements which in spite of every effort will always break out
          afresh in accordance with the very origin of human nature. Art has
          to perform this duty especially in regard to the passions and
          spiritual agonies and anxieties, and to cause the significant
          factor to shine through unavoidable or unconquerable ugliness. To
          this great, super-great task the so-called art proper, that of
          works of art, is a mere accessary. A man who feels within himself a
          surplus of such powers of embellishment, concealment, and
          transfiguration will finally seek to unburden himself of this
          surplus in works of art. The same holds good, under special
          circumstances, of a whole nation.—But as a rule we nowadays begin
          art at the end, hang on to its tail, and think that works of art
          constitute art proper, and that life should be improved and
          transformed by this means—fools that we are! If we begin a dinner
          with dessert, and try sweet after sweet, small wonder that we ruin
          our digestions and even our appetites for the good, hearty,
          nourishing meal to which art invites us!</p>

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg093"></a> fill up their time
          without music, theatres and picture-galleries, novels and poetry.
          Granted that one could keep them from this indulgence, either they
          would strive less eagerly for leisure, and the invidious sight of
          the rich would be less common (a great gain for the stability of
          society), or they would have leisure, but would learn to reflect on
          what can be learnt and unlearnt: on their work, for instance, their

          the exception of the artist, would in both cases reap the

          could take objection to this. Still, it must be said on behalf of

          whence he derives all his intellectual wisdom—from father and
          mother, from teachers and books of all kinds, from the street and
          particularly from the priest. He is deceived by his own art, and

          venture so high. In himself a Phidias is quite possible as a poet,

          in the sense that to God nothing is impossible. The desire for a
          poetical Claude Lorrain is already an immodesty at present, however
          earnestly one man's heart may yearn for such a consummation.—The
          presentment of the highest man, the most simple and at the same

          observation, lies in the coherent and vivid recollection of our own
          experience, a striving towards genius in humanity collectively
          might be deduced from the striving towards knowledge of the whole
          historic past—which is beginning to mark off the modern age more
          and more as compared with earlier ages and has for the first time
          broken down the barriers between nature and spirit, men and
          animals, morality and physics. A perfectly conceived history would

          all-too-human of their natures, their blindnesses, deformities, and
          extravagances, so that their more powerful, easily all-too-powerful
          influence may be continually held within bounds through the
          distrust aroused by such qualities. For the sum-total of all that
          humanity needs for its continued existence is so comprehensive, and
          demands powers so diverse and so numerous, that for every one-sided
          predilection, whether in science or politics or art or commerce, to
          which such natures would persuade us, mankind as a whole has to pay
          a heavy price. It has always been a great disaster to culture when
          human beings are worshipped. In this sense we may understand the
          precept of Mosaic law which forbids us to have any other gods but
          God.—Side by side with the cult of genius and violence we must
          always place, as its complement and remedy, the cult of culture.
          This cult can find an intelligent appreciation even for the
          material, the inferior, the mean, the misunderstood, the weak, the
          imperfect, the one-sided, the incomplete, the untrue, the apparent,
          even the wicked and horrible, and can grant them the concession

          painlessness and the removal of sources of discomfort. With regard
          to suffering existence, the ancients sought to forget or in some

          Character of the Greeks.</span></span>—We are easily led astray by
          the renowned Greek clearness, transparency, simplicity, and order,
          by their crystal-like naturalness and crystal-like art, into
          believing that all these gifts were bestowed on the Greeks—for
          instance, that they could not but write well, as Lichtenberg
          expressed it on one occasion. Yet no statement could be more hasty
          and more untenable. The history of prose from Gorgias to
          Demosthenes shows a course of toiling and wrestling towards light
          from the obscure, overloaded, and tasteless, reminding one of the
          labour of heroes who had to construct the first roads through
          forest and bog. The dialogue of tragedy was the real achievement of
          the dramatist, owing to its uncommon clearness and precision,
          whereas the national tendency was to riot in symbolism and
          innuendo, a tendency expressly fostered by the great choral
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg112"></a> lyric. Similarly it
          was the achievement of Homer to liberate the Greeks from Asiatic
          pomp and gloom, and to have attained the clearness of architecture
          in details great and small. Nor was it by any means thought easy to
          say anything in a pure and illuminating style. How else should we
          account for the great admiration for the epigram of Simonides,
          which shows itself so simple, with no gilded points or arabesques
          of wit, but says all that it has to say plainly and with the calm
          of the sun, not with the straining after effect of the lightning.
          Since the struggle towards light from an almost native twilight is
          Greek, a thrill of jubilation runs through the people when they
          hear a laconic sentence, the language of elegy or the maxims of the
          Seven Wise Men. Hence they were so fond of giving precepts in
          verse, a practice that we find objectionable. This was the true
          Apolline task of the Hellenic spirit, with the aim of rising
          superior to the perils of metre and the obscurity which is
          otherwise characteristic of poetry. Simplicity, flexibility, and
          sobriety were wrestled for and not given by nature to this people.
          The danger of a relapse into Asianism constantly hovered over the
          Greeks, and really overtook them from time to time like a murky,
          overflowing tide of mystical impulses, primitive savagery and
          darkness. We see them plunge in; we see Europe, as it were,
          flooded, washed away—for Europe was very small then; but they
          always emerge once more to the light, good swimmers and divers that
          they are, those fellow-countrymen of Odysseus.</p>

          Characteristic.</span></span>—Perhaps there is nothing more
          astonishing to the observer of the Greek world than to discover
          that the Greeks from time to time held festivals, as it were, for
          all their passions and evil tendencies alike, and in fact even
          established a kind of series of festivals, by order of the State,
          for their <span class="tei tei-q">“all-too-human.”</span> This is
          the pagan characteristic of their world, which Christianity has
          never understood and never can understand, and has always combated
          and despised.—They accepted this all-too-human as unavoidable, and
          preferred, instead of railing at it, to give it a kind of secondary
          right by grafting it on to the usages of society and religion. All
          in man that has power they called divine, and wrote it on the walls
          of their heaven. They do not deny this natural instinct that
          expresses itself in evil characteristics, but regulate and limit it
          to definite cults and days, so as to turn those turbulent streams
          into as harmless a course as possible, after devising sufficient
          precautionary measures. That is the root of all the moral
          broad-mindedness of antiquity. To the wicked, the dubious, the
          backward, the animal element, as to the barbaric, pre-Hellenic and
          Asiatic, which still lived in the depths of Greek nature, they
          allowed a moderate outflow, and did not strive to destroy it
          utterly. The whole system was under the domain of the State, which
          was built up not on individuals or castes, but on common human
          qualities. In the structure of the State the Greeks show that
          wonderful sense for typical facts which later on enabled them to
          become investigators of Nature, historians, geographers, and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg114"></a> philosophers. It was
          not a limited moral law of priests or castes, which had to decide
          about the constitution of the State and State worship, but the most
          comprehensive view of the reality of all that is human. Whence do
          the Greeks derive this freedom, this sense of reality? Perhaps from
          Homer and the poets who preceded him. For just those poets whose
          nature is generally not the most wise or just possess, in
          compensation, that delight in reality and activity of every kind,
          and prefer not to deny even evil. It suffices for them if evil
          moderates itself, does not kill or inwardly poison everything—in
          other words, they have similar ideas to those of the founders of
          Greek constitutions, and were their teachers and forerunners.</p>

          the First nor the Last Thing in Point of Time.</span></span>—In the
          history of religious ideas many errors about development and false
          gradations are made in matters which in reality are not consecutive
          outgrowths but contemporary yet separate phenomena. In particular,
          simplicity has still far too much the reputation of being the
          oldest, the initial thing. Much that is human arises by subtraction
          and division, and not merely by doubling, addition, and
          unification.—For instance, men still believe in a gradual
          development of the idea of God from those unwieldy stones and
          blocks of wood up to the highest forms of anthropomorphism. Yet the
          fact is that so long as divinity was attributed to and felt in
          trees, logs of wood, stones, and beasts, people shrank from
          humanising their forms as from an act of godlessness. First of all,
          poets, apart from all considerations of cult and the ban of
          religious shame, have had to make the inner imagination of man
          accustomed and compliant to this notion. Wherever more pious
          periods and phases of thought gained the upper hand, this
          liberating influence of poets fell into the background, and
          sanctity remained, after as before, on the side of the monstrous,
          uncanny, quite peculiarly inhuman. And then, much of what the inner
          imagination ventures to picture to itself would exert a painful
          influence if externally and corporeally represented. The inner eye
          is far bolder and more shameless than the outer (whence the
          well-known difficulty and, to some extent, impossibility, of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg116"></a> working epic
          material into dramatic form). The religious imagination for a long
          time entirely refuses to believe in the identity of God with an
          image: the image is meant to fix the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">numen</span></span> of the Deity, actually and
          specifically, although in a mysterious and not altogether
          intelligible way. The oldest image of the Gods is meant to shelter
          and at the same time to hide<a href="#note_14" id="noteref_14" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> the
          God—to indicate him but not to expose him to view. No Greek really
          looked upon his Apollo as a pointed pillar of wood, his Eros as a
          lump of stone. These were symbols, which were intended to inspire
          dread of the manifestation of the God. It was the same with those
          blocks of wood out of which individual limbs, generally in
          excessive number, were fashioned with the scantiest of carving—as,
          for instance, a Laconian Apollo with four hands and four ears. In
          the incomplete, symbolical, or excessive lies a terrible sanctity,
          which is meant to prevent us from thinking of anything human or
          similar to humanity. It is not an embryonic stage of art in which
          such things are made—as if they were not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">able</span></em> to
          speak more plainly and portray more sensibly in the age when such
          images were honoured! Rather, men are afraid of just one
          thing—direct speaking out. Just as the cella hides and conceals in
          a mysterious twilight, yet not completely, the holy of holies, the
          real <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">numen</span></span> of the Deity; just as,
          again, the peripteric temple hides the cella, protecting it from
          indiscreet eyes as with a screen and a veil, yet not completely—so
          it is with the image of the Deity, and at the same time the
          concealment of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg
          117]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg117"></a>
          the Deity.—Only when outside the cult, in the profane world of
          athletic contest, the joy in the victor had risen so high that the
          ripples thus started reacted upon the lake of religious emotion,
          was the statue of the victor set up before the temple. Then the
          pious pilgrim had to accustom his eye and his soul, whether he
          would or no, to the inevitable sight of human beauty and
          super-strength, so that the worship of men and Gods melted into
          each other from physical and spiritual contact. Then too for the
          first time the fear of really humanising the figures of the Gods is
          lost, and the mighty arena for great plastic art is opened—even now
          with the limitation that wherever there is to be adoration the
          primitive form and ugliness are carefully preserved and copied. But
          the Hellene, as he dedicates and makes offerings, may now with
          religious sanction indulge in his delight in making God become a
          man.</p>

          Travel.</span></span>—Immediate self-observation is not enough, by
          a long way, to enable us to learn to know ourselves. We need
          history, for the past continues to flow through us in a hundred
          channels. We ourselves are, after all, nothing but our own
          sensation at every moment of this continued flow. Even here, when
          we wish to step down into the stream of our apparently most
          peculiar and personal development, Heraclitus' aphorism,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“You cannot step twice into the same
          river,”</span> holds good.—This is a piece of wisdom which has,
          indeed, gradually become trite, but nevertheless has remained as
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg118"></a> strong and true as
          it ever was. It is the same with the saying that, in order to
          understand history, we must scrutinise the living remains of
          historical periods; that we must travel, as old Herodotus
          travelled, to other nations, especially to those so-called savage
          or half-savage races in regions where man has doffed or not yet
          donned European garb. For they are ancient and firmly established
          steps of culture on which we can stand. There is, however, a more
          subtle art and aim in travelling, which does not always necessitate
          our passing from place to place and going thousands of miles away.
          Very probably the last three centuries, in all their colourings and
          refractions of culture, survive even in our vicinity, only they
          have to be discovered. In some families, or even in individuals,
          the strata are still superimposed on each other, beautifully and
          perceptibly; in other places there are dispersions and
          displacements of the structure which are harder to understand.
          Certainly in remote districts, in less known mountain valleys,
          circumscribed communities have been able more easily to maintain an
          admirable pattern of a far older sentiment, a pattern that must
          here be investigated. On the other hand, it is improbable that such
          discoveries will be made in Berlin, where man comes into the world
          washed-out and sapless. He who after long practice of this art of
          travel has become a hundred-eyed Argus will accompany his Io—I mean
          his ego—everywhere, and in Egypt and Greece, Byzantium and Rome,
          France and Germany, in the age of wandering or settled races, in
          Renaissance or Reformation, at home and abroad, in sea, forest,
          plant, and mountain, will again <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg119"></a> light upon the travel-adventure of this
          ever-growing, ever-altered ego.—Thus self-knowledge becomes
          universal knowledge as regards the entire past, and, by another
          chain of observation, which can only be indicated here,
          self-direction and self-training in the freest and most far-seeing
          spirits might become universal direction as regards all future
          humanity.</p>

          Poison.</span></span>—We cannot ponder too deeply on this fact:
          Christianity is the religion of antiquity grown old; it presupposes
          degenerate old culture-stocks, and on them it had, and still has,
          power to work like balm. There are periods when ears and eyes are
          full of slime, so that they can no longer hear the voice of reason
          and philosophy or see the wisdom that walks in bodily shape,
          whether it bears the name of Epictetus or of Epicurus. Then,
          perhaps, the erection of the martyr's cross and the <span class="tei tei-q">“trumpet of the last judgment”</span> may have the
          effect of still inspiring such races to end their lives decently.
          If we think of Juvenal's Rome, of that poisonous toad with the eyes
          of Venus, we understand what it means to make the sign of the Cross
          before the world, we honour the silent Christian community and are
          grateful for its having stifled the Greco-Roman Empire. If, indeed,
          most men were then born in spiritual slavery, with the sensuality
          of old men, what a pleasure to meet beings who were more soul than
          body, and who seemed to realise the Greek idea of the shades of the
          under-world—shy, scurrying, chirping, kindly creatures, with a
          reversion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg

          on the <span class="tei tei-q">“better life,”</span> and therefore
          so unassuming, so secretly scornful, so proudly patient!—This
          Christianity, as the evening chime of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>
          antiquity, with cracked, weary and yet melodious bell, is balm in
          the ears even to one who only now traverses those centuries
          historically. What must it have been to those men themselves!—To
          young and fresh barbarian nations, on the other hand, Christianity
          is a poison. For to implant the teaching of sinfulness and
          damnation in the heroic, childlike, and animal soul of the old
          Germans is nothing but poisoning. An enormous chemical fermentation
          and decomposition, a medley of sentiments and judgments, a rank
          growth of adventurous legend, and hence in the long run a
          fundamental weakening of such barbarian peoples, was the inevitable
          result. True, without this weakening what should we have left of
          Greek culture, of the whole cultured past of the human race? For
          the barbarians untouched by Christianity knew very well how to make
          a clean sweep of old cultures, as was only too clearly shown by the
          heathen conquerors of Romanised Britain. Thus Christianity, against
          its will, was compelled to aid in making <span class="tei tei-q">“the antique world”</span> immortal.—There remains,
          however, a counter-question and the possibility of a
          counter-reckoning. Without this weakening through the poisoning
          referred to, would any of those fresh stocks—the Germans, for
          instance—have been in a position gradually to find by themselves a
          higher, a peculiar, a new culture, of which the most distant
          conception would therefore have been lost to humanity?—In this, as
          in every case, we do not know, Christianly speaking, whether God
          owes the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg

          Holy and Condemns.</span></span>—A Christian who happened upon
          forbidden paths of thought might well ask himself on some occasion
          whether it is really necessary that there should be a God, side by
          side with a representative Lamb, if faith in the existence of these
          beings suffices to produce the same influences? If they do exist
          after all, are they not superfluous beings? For all that is given
          by the Christian religion to the human soul, all that is
          beneficent, consoling, and edifying, just as much as all that
          depresses and crushes, emanates from that faith and not from the
          objects of that faith. It is here as in another well-known
          case—there were indeed no witches, but the terrible effects of the
          belief in witches were the same as if they really had existed. For
          all occasions where the Christian awaits the immediate intervention
          of a God, though in vain (for there is no God), his religion is
          inventive enough to find subterfuges and reasons for tranquillity.
          In so far Christianity is an ingenious religion.—Faith, indeed, has
          up to the present not been able to move real mountains, although I
          do not know who assumed that it could. But it can put mountains
          where there are none.</p>

          which she wills that succeeding centuries should dance, on to a few
          days, one place, the condition and opinions of one brain. Thus the
          fate of modern German history lies in the days of that disputation
          at Regensburg: the peaceful settlement of ecclesiastical and moral
          affairs, without religious wars or a counter-reformation, and also
          the unity of the German nation, seemed assured: the deep, gentle
          spirit of Contarini hovered for one moment over the theological
          squabble, victorious, as representative of the riper Italian piety,
          reflecting the morning glory of intellectual freedom. But Luther's
          hard head, full of suspicions and strange misgivings, showed
          resistance. Because justification by grace appeared to him
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> greatest motto and discovery,
          he did not believe the phrase in the mouth of Italians; whereas, in
          point of fact, as is well known, they had invented it much earlier
          and spread it throughout Italy in deep silence. In this apparent
          agreement Luther saw the tricks of the devil, and hindered the work
          of peace as well as he could, thereby advancing to a great extent
          the aims of the Empire's foes.—And now, in order to have a still
          stronger idea of the dreadful farcicality of it all, let us add
          that none of the principles about which men then disputed in
          Regensburg—neither that of original sin, nor that of redemption by
          proxy, nor that of justification by faith—is in any way true or
          even has any connection with truth: that they are now all
          recognised as incapable of being discussed. Yet on this account the
          world was set on fire—that is to say, by opinions which correspond
          to no things or realities; whereas as regards purely philological
          questions—as, for instance, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg123"></a> that of the sacramental words in the
          Eucharist—discussion at any rate is permitted, because in this case
          the truth can be said. But <span class="tei tei-q">“where nothing
          is, even truth has lost her right.”</span><a href="#note_15" id="noteref_15" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>—Lastly,
          it only remains to be said that it is true these principles give
          rise to sources of power so mighty that without them all the mills
          of the modern world could not be driven with such force. And it is
          primarily a matter of force, only secondarily of truth (and perhaps
          not even secondarily)—is it not so, my dear up-to-date friends?</p>

          Errors.</span></span>—Goethe is a signal exception among great
          artists in that he did not live within the limited confines of his
          real capacity, as if that must be the essential, the distinctive,
          the unconditional, and the last thing in him and for all the world.
          Twice he intended to possess something higher than he really
          possessed—and went astray in the second half of his life, where he
          seems quite convinced that he is one of the great scientific
          discoverers and illuminators. So too in the first half of his life
          he demanded of himself something higher than the poetic art seemed
          to him—and here already he made a mistake. That nature wished to
          make him a plastic artist,—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> was his inwardly glowing and
          scorching secret, which finally drove him to Italy, that he might
          give vent to his mania in this direction and make to it every
          possible sacrifice. At last, shrewd as he was, and honestly averse
          to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg124"></a> any mental
          perversion in himself, he discovered that a tricksy elf of desire
          had attracted him to the belief in this calling, and that he must
          free himself of the greatest passion of his heart and bid it
          farewell. The painful conviction, tearing and gnawing at his
          vitals, that it was necessary to bid farewell, finds full
          expression in the character of Tasso. Over Tasso, that Werther
          intensified, hovers the premonition of something worse than death,
          as when one says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now it is over, after
          this farewell: how shall I go on living without going mad?”</span>
          These two fundamental errors of his life gave Goethe, in face of a
          purely literary attitude towards poetry (the only attitude then
          known to the world), such an unembarrassed and apparently almost
          arbitrary position. Not to speak of the period when Schiller (poor
          Schiller, who had no time himself and left no time to others) drove
          away his shy dread of poetry, his fear of all literary life and
          craftsmanship, Goethe appears like a Greek who now and then visits
          his beloved, doubting whether she be not a Goddess to whom he can
          give no proper name. In all his poetry one notices the inspiring
          neighbourhood of plastic art and Nature. The features of these
          figures that floated before him—and perhaps he always thought he
          was on the track of the metamorphoses of one Goddess—became,
          without his will or knowledge, the features of all the children of
          his art. Without the extravagances of error he would not have been
          Goethe—that is, the only German artist in writing who has not yet
          become out of date—just because he desired as little to be a writer
          as a German by vocation.</p>

          set up a model for the choice of a legislative body. First of all
          the honest and reliable men of the nation, who at the same time are
          masters and experts in some one branch, have to become prominent by
          mutual scenting-out and recognition. From these, by a narrower
          process of selection, the learned and expert of the first rank in
          each individual branch must again be chosen, also by mutual
          recognition and guarantee. If the legislative body be composed of
          these, it will finally be necessary, in each individual case, that
          only the voices and judgments of the most specialised experts
          should decide; the honesty of all the rest should have become so
          great that it is simply a matter of decency to leave the voting
          also in the hands of these men. The result would be that the law,
          in the strictest sense, would emanate from the intelligence of the
          most intelligent.—As things now are, voting is done by parties, and
          at every division there must be hundreds of uneasy consciences
          among the ill-taught, the incapable of judgment, among those who
          merely repeat, imitate, and go with the tide. Nothing lowers the
          dignity of a new law so much as this inherent shamefaced feeling of
          insincerity that necessarily results at every <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg151"></a> party division. But, as has been said,
          it is easy, ridiculously easy, to set up such a model: no power on
          earth is at present strong enough to realise such an ideal—unless
          the belief in the highest utility of knowledge, and of those that
          know, at last dawns even upon the most hostile minds and is
          preferred to the prevalent belief in majorities. In the sense of
          such a future may our watchword be: <span class="tei tei-q">“More

          to Newcastle.</span></span>—The governments of the great States
          have two instruments for keeping the people dependent, in fear and
          obedience: a coarser, the army, and a more refined, the school.
          With the aid of the former they win over to their side the ambition
          of the higher strata and the strength of the lower, so far as both
          are characteristic of active and energetic men of moderate or
          inferior gifts. With the aid of the latter they win over gifted
          poverty, especially the intellectually pretentious semi-poverty of
          the middle classes. Above all, they make teachers of all grades
          into an intellectual court looking unconsciously <span class="tei tei-q">“towards the heights.”</span> By putting obstacle after
          obstacle in the way of private schools and the wholly distasteful
          individual tuition they secure the disposal of a considerable
          number of educational posts, towards which numerous hungry and
          submissive eyes are turned to an extent five times as great as can
          ever be satisfied. These posts, however, must support the holder
          but meagrely, so that he maintains a feverish thirst for promotion
          and becomes still more closely attached to the views of the
          government. For it is always more advantageous to foster moderate
          discontent than contentment, the mother of courage, the grandmother
          of free thought and exuberance. By means of this physically and
          mentally bridled body of teachers, the youth of the country is as
          far as possible raised to a certain level of culture that is useful
          to the State and arranged on a suitable sliding-scale. Above all,
          the immature <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg
          153]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg153"></a>
          and ambitious minds of all classes are almost imperceptibly imbued
          with the idea that only a career which is recognised and
          hall-marked by the State can lead immediately to social
          distinction. The effect of this belief in government examinations
          and titles goes so far that even men who have remained independent
          and have risen by trade or handicraft still feel a pang of
          discontent in their hearts until their position too is marked and
          acknowledged by a gracious bestowal of rank and orders from
          above—until one becomes a <span class="tei tei-q">“somebody.”</span> Finally the State connects all these
          hundreds of offices and posts in its hands with the obligation of
          being trained and hallmarked in these State schools if one ever
          wishes to enter this charmed circle. Honour in society, daily
          bread, the possibility of a family, protection from above, the
          feeling of community in a common culture—all this forms a network
          of hopes into which every young man walks: how should he feel the
          slightest breath of mistrust? In the end, perhaps, the obligation
          of being a soldier for one year has become with every one, after
          the lapse of a few generations, an unreflecting habit, an
          understood thing, with an eye to which we construct the plan of our
          lives quite early. Then the State can venture on the master-stroke
          of weaving together school and army, talent, ambition and strength
          by means of common advantages—that is, by attracting the more
          highly gifted on favourable terms to the army and inspiring them
          with the military spirit of joyful obedience; so that finally,
          perhaps, they become attached permanently to the flag and endow it
          by their talents with an ever new and more brilliant <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg154"></a> lustre. Then nothing more is wanted but
          an opportunity for great wars. These are provided from professional
          reasons (and so in all innocence) by diplomats, aided by newspapers
          and Stock Exchanges. For <span class="tei tei-q">“the

          with a good conscience in war—it has one already.</p>

          far more than has hitherto been observed, only in the differences
          of various grades of culture, and are only to a very small extent
          permanent (nor even that in a strict sense). For this reason all
          arguments based on national character are so little binding on one
          who aims at the alteration of convictions—in other words, at
          culture. If, for instance, we consider all that has already been
          German, we shall improve upon the hypothetical question,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“What is German?”</span> by the
          counter-question, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em>
          German?”</span> and every good German will answer it practically,
          by overcoming his German characteristics. For when a nation
          advances and grows, it bursts the girdle previously given to it by
          its national outlook. When it remains stationary or declines, its
          soul is surrounded by a fresh girdle, and the crust, as it becomes
          harder and harder, builds a prison around, with walls growing ever
          higher. Hence if a nation has much that is firmly established, this
          is a sign that it wishes to petrify and would like to become
          nothing but a monument. This happened, from a definite date, in the
          case of Egypt. So he who is well-disposed towards the Germans may
          for his part consider how he may more and more grow out of what is
          German. The tendency to be un-German has therefore always been a
          mark of efficient members of our nation.</p>

          believed that Uhland was a poet and Goethe immoral.—The best about
          German novels now in vogue was that one need not read them, for one
          knew already what they contained.—The native of Berlin seemed more
          good-humoured than the South German, for he was all too fond of
          mocking, and so could endure mockery himself, which the South
          German could not.—The intellect of the Germans was kept down by
          their beer and their newspapers: he recommended them tea and
          pamphlets, of course as a cure.—He advised us to contemplate the
          different nations of worn-out Europe and see how well each
          displayed some particular quality of old age, to the delight of
          those who sit before the great spectacle: how the French
          successfully represent the cleverness and amiability of old age,
          the English the experience and reserve, the Italians the innocence
          and candour. Can the other masks of old age be wanting? Where is
          the proud old man, the domineering old man, the covetous old
          man?—The most dangerous region in Germany was Saxony and Thuringia:
          nowhere else was there more mental nimbleness, more knowledge of
          men, side by side with freedom of thought; and all this was so
          modestly veiled by the ugly dialect and the zealous officiousness
          of the inhabitants that one hardly noticed that one here had to
          deal with the intellectual drill-sergeants of Germany, her teachers
          for good or evil.—The arrogance of the North Germans was kept in
          check by their tendency to obey, that of the South Germans by their
          tendency—to make themselves comfortable.—It appeared to him that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg157"></a> in their women
          German men possessed awkward but self-opinionated housewives, who
          belauded themselves so perseveringly that they had almost persuaded
          the world, and at any rate their husbands, of their peculiarly
          German housewifely virtue.—When the conversation turned on
          Germany's home and foreign policy, he used to say (he called it
          <span class="tei tei-q">“betray the secret”</span>) that Germany's
          greatest statesman did not believe in great statesmen.—The future
          of Germany he found menaced and menacing, for Germans had forgotten
          how to enjoy themselves (an art that the Italians understood so
          well), but, by the great games of chance called wars and dynastic
          revolutions, had accustomed themselves to emotionalism, and
          consequently would one day have an <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">émeute</span></span>. For that is the
          strongest emotion that a nation can procure for itself.—The German
          Socialist was all the more dangerous because impelled by no
          definite necessity: his trouble lay in not knowing what he wanted;
          so, even if he attained many of his objects, he would still pine
          away from desire in the midst of delights, just like Faust, but
          presumably like a very vulgar Faust. <span class="tei tei-q">“For

        For the existence of beauty of face, clearness of speech, kindliness

        They are not opponents—rather do they hold each other's hands like

          Consolation.</span></span>—Epicurus, the soul-comforter of later
          antiquity, said, with that marvellous insight which to this very
          day is so rarely to be found, that for the calming of the spirit
          the solution of the final and ultimate theoretical problems is by
          no means necessary. Hence, instead of raising a barren and remote
          discussion of the final question, whether the Gods existed, it
          sufficed him to say to those who were tormented by <span class="tei tei-q">“fear of the Gods”</span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“If
          there are Gods, they do not concern themselves with us.”</span> The
          latter position is far stronger and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg188"></a> more favourable, for, by conceding a few
          points to the other, one makes him readier to listen and to take to
          heart. But as soon as he sets about proving the opposite (that the
          Gods do concern themselves with us), into what thorny jungles of
          error must the poor man fall, quite of his own accord, and without
          any cunning on the part of his interlocutor! The latter must only
          have enough subtlety and humanity to conceal his sympathy with this
          tragedy. Finally, the other comes to feel disgust—the strongest
          argument against any proposition—disgust with his own hypothesis.
          He becomes cold, and goes away in the same frame of mind as the
          pure atheist who says, <span class="tei tei-q">“What do the Gods
          matter to me? The devil take them!”</span>—In other cases,
          especially when a half-physical, half-moral assumption had cast a
          gloom over his spirit, Epicurus did not refute the assumption. He
          agreed that it might be true, but that there was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a second
          assumption</span></em> to explain the same phenomenon, and that it
          could perhaps be maintained in other ways. The plurality of
          hypotheses (for example, that concerning the origin of
          conscientious scruples) suffices even in our time to remove from
          the soul the shadows that arise so easily from pondering over a
          hypothesis which is isolated, merely visible, and hence overvalued
          a hundredfold.—Thus whoever wishes to console the unfortunate, the
          criminal, the hypochondriac, the dying, may call to mind the two
          soothing suggestions of Epicurus, which can be applied to a great
          number of problems. In their simplest form they would run: firstly,
          granted the thing is so, it does not concern us; secondly, the
          thing may be so, but it may also be otherwise.</p>

          at the very point where they are most securely fettered. It is as

          his vitality is strongest; hence, as I have said, now in passion,
          now in duty, now in knowledge, now in caprice. A man unconsciously
          imagines that where he is strong, where he feels most thoroughly
          alive, the element of his freedom must lie. He thinks of dependence
          and apathy, independence and vivacity as forming inevitable
          pairs.—Thus an experience that a man has undergone in the social
          and political sphere is wrongly transferred to the ultimate

          there the vivid feeling of joy and sorrow, the high hopes, the keen

          independent natures, while the thrall and the slave live in a state

          however, the reverse to be true—that he is always living in a
          complex state of dependence, but thinks himself free where, through
          long habit, he no longer feels the weight of the chain? He only
          suffers from new chains, and <span class="tei tei-q">“free

          Will and the Isolation of Facts.</span></span>—Our ordinary
          inaccurate observation takes a group of phenomena as one and calls
          them a fact. Between this fact and another we imagine a vacuum, we
          isolate each fact. In reality, however, the sum of our actions and
          cognitions is no series of facts and intervening vacua, but a
          continuous stream. Now the belief in free will is incompatible with
          the idea of a continuous, uniform, undivided, indivisible flow.
          This belief presupposes that every single action is isolated and
          indivisible; it is an atomic theory as regards volition and
          cognition.—We misunderstand facts as we misunderstand characters,
          speaking of similar characters and similar facts, whereas both are
          non-existent. Further, we bestow praise and blame only on this
          false hypothesis, that there are similar facts, that a graduated
          order of species of facts exists, corresponding to a graduated
          order of values. Thus we isolate not only the single fact, but the
          groups of apparently equal facts (good, evil, compassionate,
          envious actions, and so forth). In both cases we are wrong.—The
          word and the concept are the most obvious reason for our belief in
          this isolation of groups of actions. We do not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg192"></a> merely thereby designate the things;
          the thought at the back of our minds is that by the word and the
          concept we can grasp the essence of the actions. We are still
          constantly led astray by words and actions, and are induced to
          think of things as simpler than they are, as separate, indivisible,
          existing in the absolute. Language contains a hidden philosophical
          mythology, which, however careful we may be, breaks out afresh at
          every moment. The belief in free will—that is to say, in similar
          facts and isolated facts—finds in language its continual apostle
          and advocate.</p>

          believes in the identity of certain facts, certain sensations, and
          in that case finds spiritual pleasure and pain in comparing present
          with past conditions and in noting their similarity or difference
          (as is invariably the case with recollection); or he believes in
          the freedom of the will, perhaps when he reflects, <span class="tei tei-q">“I ought not to have done this,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“This might have turned out differently,”</span> and
          from these reflections likewise he derives pleasure and pain.
          Without the errors that are rife in every psychical pain and
          pleasure, humanity would never have developed. For the root idea of
          humanity is that man is free in a world of bondage—man, the eternal

          incomparable. Our uniqueness in the world! Oh, what an improbable
          thing it is! Astronomers, who occasionally acquire a horizon
          outside our world, give us to understand that the drop of life on
          the earth is without significance for the total character of the
          mighty ocean of birth and decay; that countless stars present
          conditions for the generation of life similar to those of the
          earth—and yet these are but a handful in comparison with the
          endless number that have never known, or have long been cured, of
          the eruption of life; that life on each of these stars, measured by
          the period of its existence, has been but an instant, a flicker,
          with long, long intervals afterwards—and thus in no way the aim and
          final purpose of their existence. Possibly the ant in the forest is
          quite as firmly convinced that it is the aim and purpose of the
          existence of the forest, as we are convinced in our imaginations
          (almost unconsciously) that the destruction of mankind involves the
          destruction of the world. It is even modesty on our part to go no
          farther than this, and not to arrange a universal twilight of the
          world and the Gods as the funeral ceremony of the last man. Even to
          the eye of the most unbiassed astronomer a lifeless world can
          scarcely appear otherwise than as a shining and swinging star

          establish concerning the first and last things, and until then to
          think (and especially to believe) in the traditional way, as one is
          so often advised to do. The impulse that bids us seek nothing but
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainties</span></em> in this domain is a
          religious offshoot, nothing better—a hidden and only apparently
          sceptical variety of the <span class="tei tei-q">“metaphysical
          need,”</span> the underlying idea being that for a long time no
          view of these ultimate certainties will be obtainable, and that
          until then the <span class="tei tei-q">“believer”</span> has the
          right not to trouble himself about the whole subject. We have no
          need of these certainties about the farthermost horizons in order
          to live a full and efficient human life, any more than the ant
          needs them in order to be a good ant. Rather must we ascertain the
          origin of that troublesome significance that we have attached to
          these things for so long. For this we require the history of
          ethical and religious sentiments, since it is only under the
          influence of such sentiments that these most acute problems of
          knowledge have become so weighty and terrifying. Into the outermost
          regions to which the mental eye can penetrate (without ever
          penetrating <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">into</span></em> them), we have smuggled such
          concepts as guilt and punishment (everlasting punishment, too!).
          The darker those regions, the more careless we have been. For ages
          men have let their imaginations run riot where they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg196"></a> could establish nothing, and have
          induced posterity to accept these fantasies as something serious
          and true, with this abominable lie as their final trump-card: that
          faith is worth more than knowledge. What we need now in regard to
          these ultimate things is not knowledge as against faith, but
          indifference as against faith and pretended knowledge in these
          matters!—Everything must lie nearer to us than what has hitherto
          been preached to us as the most important thing, I mean the
          questions: <span class="tei tei-q">“What end does man
          serve?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What is his fate after
          death?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“How does he make his peace
          with God?”</span> and all the rest of that bag of tricks. The
          problems of the dogmatic philosophers, be they idealists,
          materialists, or realists, concern us as little as do these
          religious questions. They all have the same object in view—to force
          us to a decision in matters where neither faith nor knowledge is
          needed. It is better even for the most ardent lover of knowledge
          that the territory open to investigation and to reason should be
          encircled by a belt of fog-laden, treacherous marshland, a strip of
          ever watery, impenetrable, and indeterminable country. It is just
          by the comparison with the realm of darkness on the edge of the
          world of knowledge that the bright, accessible region of that world
          rises in value.—We must once more become good friends of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“everyday matters,”</span> and not, as
          hitherto, despise them and look beyond them at clouds and monsters
          of the night. In forests and caverns, in marshy tracts and under
          dull skies, on the lowest rungs of the ladder of culture, man has
          lived for æons, and lived in poverty. There he has learnt to
          despise the present, his neighbours, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg197"></a> his life, and himself, and we, the

          metaphysicians are in the same relation, or even in a worse
          relation, to the text of Nature. For, to apply their profound
          interpretations, they often alter the text to suit their
          purpose—or, in other words, corrupt the text. A curious example of
          the corruption and obscuration of an author's text is furnished by
          the ideas of Schopenhauer on the pregnancy of women. <span class="tei tei-q">“The sign of a continuous will to life in time,”</span>
          he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“is copulation; the sign of the
          light of knowledge which is associated anew with this will and
          holds the possibility of a deliverance, and that too in the highest
          degree of clearness, is the renewed incarnation of the will to
          life. This incarnation is betokened by pregnancy, which is
          therefore frank and open, and even proud, whereas copulation hides
          itself like a criminal.”</span> He declares that every woman, if
          surprised in the sexual act, would be likely to die of shame, but
          <span class="tei tei-q">“displays her pregnancy without a trace of
          shame, nay even with a sort of pride.”</span> Now, firstly, this
          condition cannot easily be displayed more aggressively than it
          displays itself, and when <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg
          198]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg198"></a>
          Schopenhauer gives prominence only to the intentional character of
          the display, he is fashioning his text to suit the interpretation.
          Moreover, his statement of the universality of the phenomenon is
          not true. He speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“every
          woman.”</span> Many women, especially the younger, often appear
          painfully ashamed of their condition, even in the presence of their
          nearest kinsfolk. And when women of riper years, especially in the
          humbler classes, do actually appear proud of their condition, it is
          because they would give us to understand that they are still
          desirable to their husbands. That a neighbour on seeing them or a
          passing stranger should say or think <span class="tei tei-q">“Can
          it be possible?”</span>—that is an alms always acceptable to the
          vanity of women of low mental capacity. In the reverse instance, to
          conclude from Schopenhauer's proposition, the cleverest and most
          intelligent women would tend more than any to exult openly in their
          condition. For they have the best prospect of giving birth to an
          intellectual prodigy, in whom <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          will”</span> can once more <span class="tei tei-q">“negative”</span> itself for the universal good. Stupid
          women, on the other hand, would have every reason to hide their
          pregnancy more modestly than anything they hide.—It cannot be said
          that this view corresponds to reality. Granted, however, that
          Schopenhauer was right on the general principle that women show
          more self-satisfaction when pregnant than at any other time, a
          better explanation than this lies to hand. One might imagine the
          clucking of a hen even before she lays an egg, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Look! look! I shall lay an egg! I shall lay an

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Principle of
          Equilibrium.</span></span>—The robber and the man of power who
          promises to protect a community from robbers are perhaps at bottom
          beings of the same mould, save that the latter attains his ends by
          other means than the former—that is to say, through regular imposts
          paid to him by the community, and no longer through forced
          contributions. (The same relation exists between <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg201"></a> merchant and pirate, who for a long
          period are one and the same person: where the one function appears
          to them inadvisable, they exercise the other. Even to-day
          mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement on piratical
          morality—buying in the cheapest market, at prime cost if possible,
          and selling in the dearest.) The essential point is that the man of
          power promises to maintain the equilibrium against the robber, and
          herein the weak find a possibility of living. For either they must
          group themselves into an equivalent power, or they must subject
          themselves to some one of equivalent power (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
          render service in return for his efforts). The latter course is
          generally preferred, because it really keeps two dangerous beings
          in check—the robber through the man of power, and the man of power
          through the standpoint of advantage; for the latter profits by
          treating his subjects with graciousness and tolerance, in order
          that they may support not only themselves but their ruler. As a
          matter of fact, conditions may still be hard and cruel enough, yet
          in comparison with the complete annihilation that was formerly
          always a possibility, men breathe freely.—The community is at first
          the organisation of the weak to counterbalance menacing forces. An
          organisation to outweigh those forces would be more advisable, if
          its members grew strong enough to destroy the adverse power: and
          when it is a question of one mighty oppressor, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">attempt
          will</span></em> certainly be made. But if the one man is the head
          of a clan, or if he has a large following, a rapid and decisive
          annihilation is improbable, and a long or permanent feud is only to
          be expected. This feud, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg
          202]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg202"></a>
          however, involves the least desirable condition for the community,
          for it thereby loses the time to provide for its means of
          subsistence with the necessary regularity, and sees the product of
          all work hourly threatened. Hence the community prefers to raise
          its power of attack and defence to the exact plane on which the
          power of its dangerous neighbour stands, and to give him to
          understand that an equal weight now lies in its own side of the
          scales—so why not be good friends?—Thus equilibrium is a most
          important conception for the understanding of the ancient doctrines
          of law and morals. Equilibrium is, in fact, the basis of justice.
          When justice in ruder ages says, <span class="tei tei-q">“An eye
          for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,”</span> it presupposes the
          attainment of this equilibrium and tries to maintain it by means of
          this compensation; so that, when crime is committed, the injured
          party will not take the revenge of blind anger. By means of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">jus talionis</span></span> the equilibrium of
          the disturbed relations of power is restored, for in such primitive
          times an eye or an arm more means a bit more power, more weight.—In
          a community where all consider themselves equal, disgrace and
          punishment await crime—that is, violations of the principle of
          equilibrium. Disgrace is thrown into the scale as a counter-weight
          against the encroaching individual, who has gained profit by his
          encroachment, and now suffers losses (through disgrace) which annul
          and outweigh the previous profits. Punishment, in the same way,
          sets up a far greater counter-weight against the preponderance
          which every criminal hopes to obtain—imprisonment as against a deed
          of violence, restitution <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg
          203]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg203"></a>
          and fines as against theft. Thus the sinner is reminded that his
          action has excluded him from the community and from its moral
          advantages, since the community treats him as an inferior, a weaker
          brother, an outsider. For this reason punishment is not merely
          retaliation, but has something more, something of the cruelty of
          the state of nature, and of this it would serve as a reminder.</p>

          Adherents of the Doctrine of Free Will have a Right to
          Punish?</span></span>—Men whose vocation it is to judge and punish
          try to establish in every case whether an evil-doer is really
          responsible for his act, whether he was able to apply his reasoning
          powers, whether he acted with motives and not unconsciously or
          under constraint. If he is punished, it is because he preferred the
          worse to the better motives, which he must consequently have known.
          Where this knowledge is wanting, man is, according to the
          prevailing view, not responsible—unless his ignorance, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
          his <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ignorantia
          legis</span></span>, be the consequence of an intentional neglect
          to learn what he ought: in that case he already preferred the worse
          to the better motives at the time when he refused to learn, and
          must now pay the penalty of his unwise choice. If, on the other
          hand, perhaps through stupidity or shortsightedness, he has never
          seen the better motives, he is generally not punished, for people
          say that he made a wrong choice, he acted like a brute beast. The
          intentional rejection of the better reason is now needed before we
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg204"></a> treat the offender
          as fit to be punished. But how can any one be intentionally more
          unreasonable than he ought to be? Whence comes the decision, if the
          scales are loaded with good and bad motives? So the origin is not
          error or blindness, not an internal or external constraint? (It
          should furthermore be remembered that every so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“external constraint”</span> is nothing more than the
          internal constraint of fear and pain.) Whence? is the repeated
          question. So reason is not to be the cause of action, because
          reason cannot decide against the better motives? Thus we call
          <span class="tei tei-q">“free will”</span> to our aid. Absolute
          discretion is to decide, and a moment is to intervene when no
          motive exercises an influence, when the deed is done as a miracle,
          resulting from nothing. This assumed discretion is punished in a
          case where no discretion should rule. Reason, which knows law,
          prohibition, and command, should have left no choice, they say, and
          should have acted as a constraint and a higher power. Hence the
          offender is punished because he makes use of <span class="tei tei-q">“free will”</span>—in other words, has acted without
          motive where he should have been guided by motives. But why did he
          do it? This question must not even be asked; the deed was done
          without a <span class="tei tei-q">“Why?”</span> without motive,
          without origin, being a thing purposeless, unreasoned.—However,
          according to the above-named preliminary condition of
          punishability, such a deed should not be punished at all! Moreover,
          even this reason for punishing should not hold good, that in this
          case something had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> been done, had been omitted,
          that reason had not been used at all: for at any rate the omission
          was unintentional, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg
          205]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg205"></a>
          and only intentional omission is considered punishable. The
          offender has indeed preferred the worse to the better motives, but
          without motive and purpose: he has indeed failed to apply his
          reason, but not exactly with the object of not applying it. The
          very assumption made in the case of punishable crime, that the
          criminal intentionally renounced his reason, is removed by the
          hypothesis of <span class="tei tei-q">“free will.”</span> According
          to your own principles, you must not punish, you adherents of the
          doctrine of free will!—These principles are, however, nothing but a
          very marvellous conceptual mythology, and the hen that hatched them
          has brooded on her eggs far away from all reality.</p>

          comes just as illegitimate children come to women. They have done
          the same thing a hundred times without any bad consequences.
          Suddenly comes discovery, and with discovery punishment. Yet habit
          should make the deed for which the criminal is punished appear more
          excusable, for he has developed a propensity that is hard to
          resist. Instead of this, the criminal is punished more severely if
          the suspicion of habitual crime rests on him, and habit is made a
          valid reason against all extenuation. On the other hand, a model
          life, wherein crime shows up in more terrible contrast, should make
          the guilt appear more heavy! But here the custom is to soften the
          punishment. Everything is measured not from the standpoint of the
          criminal but from that of society and its losses and dangers. The
          previous utility of an individual is weighed against his one
          nefarious action, his previous criminality is added to that
          recently discovered, and punishment is thus meted out as highly as
          possible. But if we thus punish or reward a man's past (for in the
          former case the diminution of punishment is a reward) we ought to
          go farther back and punish and reward the cause of his past—I mean
          parents, teachers, society. In many instances we shall then find
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">judges</span></em> somehow or other sharing in
          the guilt. It is arbitrary to stop at the criminal himself when we

          every crime, we should stop at each individual case and probe no
          farther into the past—in other words, isolate guilt and not connect
          it with previous actions. Otherwise we sin against <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg209"></a> logic. The teachers of free will should

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Elements of
          Revenge.</span></span>—The word <span class="tei tei-q">“revenge”</span> is spoken so quickly that it almost
          seems as if it could not contain more than one conceptual and
          emotional root. Hence we are still at pains to find this root. Our
          economists, in the same way, have never wearied of scenting a
          similar unity in the word <span class="tei tei-q">“value,”</span>
          and of hunting after the primitive root idea of value. As if all
          words were not pockets, into which this or that or several things
          have been stuffed at once! So <span class="tei tei-q">“revenge”</span> is now one thing, now another, and
          sometimes more composite. Let us first distinguish that defensive
          counter-blow, which we strike, almost unconsciously, even at
          inanimate objects (such as machinery in motion) that have hurt us.
          The notion is to set a check to the object that has hurt us, by
          bringing the machine to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg
          212]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg212"></a> a
          stop. Sometimes the force of this counter-blow, in order to attain
          its object, will have to be strong enough to shatter the machine.
          If the machine be too strong to be disorganised by one man, the
          latter will all the same strike the most violent blow he can—as a
          sort of last attempt. We behave similarly towards persons who hurt
          us, at the immediate sensation of the hurt. If we like to call this
          an act of revenge, well and good: but we must remember that here
          self-preservation alone has set its cog-wheels of reason in motion,
          and that after all we do not think of the doer of the injury but
          only of ourselves. We act without any idea of doing injury in
          return, only with a view to getting away safe and sound.—It needs
          time to pass in thought from oneself to one's adversary and ask
          oneself at what point he is most vulnerable. This is done in the
          second variety of revenge, the preliminary idea of which is to
          consider the vulnerability and susceptibility of the other. The
          intention then is to give pain. On the other hand, the idea of
          securing himself against further injury is in this case so entirely
          outside the avenger's horizon, that he almost regularly brings
          about his own further injury and often foresees it in cold blood.
          If in the first sort of revenge it was the fear of a second blow
          that made the counter-blow as strong as possible, in this case
          there is an almost complete indifference to what one's adversary
          will do: the strength of the counter-blow is only determined by
          what he has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">already</span></em> done to us. Then what has
          he done? What profit is it to us if he is now suffering, after we
          have suffered through him? This is a case of readjustment, whereas
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg213"></a> first act of revenge
          only serves the purpose of self-preservation. It may be that
          through our adversary we have lost property, rank, friends,
          children—these losses are not recovered by revenge, the
          readjustment only concerns a subsidiary loss which is added to all
          the other losses. The revenge of readjustment does not preserve one
          from further injury, it does not make good the injury already
          suffered—except in one case. If our honour has suffered through our
          adversary, revenge can restore it. But in any case honour
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has</span></em> suffered an injury if
          intentional harm has been done us, because our adversary proved
          thereby that he was not afraid of us. By revenge we prove that we
          are not afraid of him either, and herein lies the settlement, the
          readjustment. (The intention of showing their complete lack of fear
          goes so far in some people that the dangers of revenge—loss of
          health or life or other losses—are in their eyes an indispensable
          condition of every vengeful act. Hence they practise the duel,
          although the law also offers them aid in obtaining satisfaction for
          what they have suffered. They are not satisfied with a safe means
          of recovering their honour, because this would not prove their
          fearlessness.)—In the first-named variety of revenge it is just
          fear that strikes the counter-blow; in the second case it is the
          absence of fear, which, as has been said, wishes to manifest itself
          in the counter-blow.—Thus nothing appears more different than the
          motives of the two courses of action which are designated by the
          one word <span class="tei tei-q">“revenge.”</span> Yet it often
          happens that the avenger is not precisely certain as to what really
          prompted his deed: perhaps he struck the counterblow <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg214"></a> from fear and the instinct of
          self-preservation, but in the background, when he has time to
          reflect upon the standpoint of wounded honour, he imagines that he
          has avenged himself for the sake of his honour—this motive is in
          any case more <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reputable</span></em> than the other. An
          essential point is whether he sees his honour injured in the eyes
          of others (the world) or only in the eyes of his offenders: in the
          latter case he will prefer secret, in the former open revenge.
          Accordingly, as he enters strongly or feebly into the soul of the
          doer and the spectator, his revenge will be more bitter or more
          tame. If he is entirely lacking in this sort of imagination, he
          will not think at all of revenge, as the feeling of <span class="tei tei-q">“honour”</span> is not present in him, and accordingly
          cannot be wounded. In the same way, he will not think of revenge if
          he despises the offender and the spectator; because as objects of
          his contempt they cannot give him honour, and accordingly cannot
          rob him of honour. Finally, he will forego revenge in the not
          uncommon case of his loving the offender. It is true that he then
          suffers loss of honour in the other's eyes, and will perhaps become
          less worthy of having his love returned. But even to renounce all
          requital of love is a sacrifice that love is ready to make when its
          only object is to avoid hurting the beloved object: this would mean
          hurting oneself more than one is hurt by the
          sacrifice.—Accordingly, every one will avenge himself, unless he be
          bereft of honour or inspired by contempt or by love for the
          offender. Even if he turns to the law-courts, he desires revenge as
          a private individual; but also, as a thoughtful, prudent man of
          society, he desires the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg
          215]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg215"></a>
          revenge of society upon one who does not respect it. Thus by legal
          punishment private honour as well as that of society is
          restored—that is to say, punishment is revenge. Punishment
          undoubtedly contains the first-mentioned element of revenge, in as
          far as by its means society helps to preserve itself, and strikes a
          counter-blow in self-defence. Punishment desires to prevent further
          injury, to scare other offenders. In this way the two elements of
          revenge, different as they are, are united in punishment, and this
          may perhaps tend most of all to maintain the above-mentioned
          confusion of ideas, thanks to which the individual avenger
          generally does not know what he really wants.</p>

          have no right to exercise certain virtues which afford us great
          honour and some pleasure as private individuals (for example,
          indulgence and favour towards miscreants of all kinds)—in short,
          every mode of action whereby the advantage of society would suffer
          through our virtue. No bench of judges, face to face with its
          conscience, may permit itself to be gracious. This privilege is
          reserved for the king as an individual, and we are glad when he
          makes use of it, proving that we should like to be gracious
          individually, but not collectively. Society recognises only the
          virtues profitable to her, or at least not injurious to her—virtues
          like justice, which are exercised without loss, or, in fact, at
          compound interest. The virtues that damage us cannot have

          society, because even now opposition to them arises in every small
          society that is in the making. Such virtues are therefore those of
          men of unequal standing, invented by the superior individuals; they
          are the virtues of rulers, and the idea underlying them is:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am mighty enough to put up with an

          reverence of those who demanded and recommended them; or from
          habit, because men had seen them done about them from childhood
          upwards; or from kindness, because the practising of them caused

          they were praised. Such actions, in which the fundamental motive,
          that of utility, has been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forgotten</span></em>, are then called moral;
          not, indeed, because they are done from those other motives, but
          because they are not done with a conscious purpose of
          utility.—Whence the hatred of utility that suddenly manifests

          all actions for the sake of utility?—Clearly society, the

          utility, which had great difficulty in prevailing over the

          there is an inherited wealth, which is owned by the gentle, the
          good-tempered, the compassionate, the indulgent. They have
          inherited from their forefathers their gentle mode of action, but
          not common sense (the source of that mode of action). The pleasant
          thing about this wealth is that one must always bestow and
          communicate a portion of it, if its presence is to be felt at all.
          Thus this wealth unconsciously aims at bridging the gulf between
          the morally rich and the morally poor, and, what is its best and
          most remarkable feature, not for the sake of a future mean between
          rich and poor, but for the sake of a universal prosperity and

          forces us to action. We call it good, and consider it outside the
          pale of discussion. The origin, limits, and justification of duty
          we will not debate or allow to be debated. But the thinker
          considers everything an evolution and every evolution a subject for
          discussion, and is accordingly without duty so long as he is merely
          a thinker. As such, he would not recognise the duty of seeing and
          speaking the truth; he would not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feel</span></em>
          the sentiment at all. He asks, whence comes it and whither will it
          go? But even this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg
          221]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg221"></a>
          questioning appears to him questionable. Surely, however, the
          consequence would be that the thinker's machinery would no longer
          work properly if he could really feel himself unencumbered by duty
          in the search for knowledge? It would appear, then, that for fuel
          the same element is necessary as must be investigated by means of
          the machine.—Perhaps the formula will be: granted there were a duty
          of recognising truth, what is then the truth in regard to every
          other kind of duty?—But is not a hypothetical sense of duty a
          contradiction in terms?</p>

          the community and saving it from destruction. Next it is a means of
          maintaining the community on a certain plane and in a certain
          degree of benevolence. Its motives are fear and hope, and these in
          a more coarse, rough, and powerful form, the more the propensity
          towards the perverse, one-sided, and personal still persists. The
          most terrible means of intimidation must be brought into play so
          long as milder forms have no effect and that twofold species of
          preservation cannot be attained. (The strongest intimidation, by
          the way, is the invention of a hereafter with a hell everlasting.)
          For this purpose we must have racks and torturers of the soul.
          Further grades of morality, and accordingly means to the end
          referred to, are the commandments of a God (as in the Mosaic law).

          with animals. Where advantage or the reverse do not come into play,
          we have a feeling of complete irresponsibility. For example, we
          kill or wound insects or let them live, and as a rule think no more
          about it. We are so clumsy that even our gracious acts towards
          flowers and small animals are almost always murderous: this does
          not in the least detract from our pleasure in them.—To-day is the
          festival of the small animals, the most sultry day of the year.
          There is a swarming and crawling around us, and we, without
          intention, but also without reflection, crush here and there a
          little fly or winged beetle.—If animals do us harm, we strive to
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">annihilate</span></em> them in every possible
          way. The means are often cruel enough, even without our really
          intending them to be so—it is the cruelty of thoughtlessness. If
          they are useful, we turn them to advantage, until a more refined
          wisdom teaches us that certain animals amply reward a different
          mode of treatment, that of tending and breeding. Here
          responsibility first arises. Torturing is avoided in the case of
          the domestic animal. One man is indignant if another is cruel to
          his cow, quite in accordance with the primitive communal morality,
          which sees the commonwealth in danger whenever an individual does
          wrong. He who perceives any transgression in the community fears
          indirect harm to himself. Thus we fear in this case for the quality
          of meat, agriculture, and means of communication if we see the
          domestic animals ill-treated. Moreover, he who is harsh to animals
          awakens a suspicion that he is also harsh to men who are weak,
          inferior, and incapable of revenge. He is held to be ignoble
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg227"></a> and deficient in the
          finer form of pride. Thus arises a foundation of moral judgments
          and sentiments, but the greatest contribution is made by
          superstition. Many animals incite men by glances, tones, and
          gestures to transfer themselves into them in imagination, and some
          religions teach us, under certain circumstances, to see in animals
          the dwelling-place of human and divine souls: whence they recommend
          a nobler caution or even a reverential awe in intercourse with
          animals. Even after the disappearance of this superstition the
          sentiments awakened by it continue to exercise their influence, to
          ripen and to blossom.—Christianity, as is well known, has shown
          itself in this respect a poor and retrograde religion.</p>

          thinks that he is struggling against fate in this way, fate is
          accomplishing its ends even in that struggle. The combat is a
          fantasy, but so is the resignation in fate—all these fantasies are
          included in fate.—The fear felt by most people of the doctrine that
          denies the freedom of the will is a fear of the fatalism of the
          Turk. They imagine that man will become weakly resigned and will
          stand before the future with folded hands, because he cannot alter
          anything of the future. Or that he will give a free rein to his
          caprices, because the predestined cannot be made worse by that
          course. The follies of men are as much a piece of fate as are his
          wise actions, and even that fear of belief in fate is a fatality.
          You yourself, you poor timid creature, are that indomitable
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Moira</span></span>, which rules even the
          Gods; whatever may happen, you are a curse or a blessing, and in
          any case the fetters wherein the strongest lies bound: in you the
          whole future of the human world is predestined, and it is no use
          for you to be frightened of yourself.</p>

          holies, which ought not to be trodden by our foot. Through the

          advance one step to meet the exacting, ecstatic piety of many of
          his patrons. He remained honest even in that exceptional picture
          which was originally intended for a banner in a procession—the
          Sistine Madonna. Here for once he wished to paint a vision, but
          such a vision as even noble youths without <span class="tei tei-q">“faith”</span> may and will have—the vision of the
          future wife, a wise, high-souled, silent, and very beautiful woman,
          carrying her first-born in her arms. Let men of an older
          generation, accustomed to prayer and devotion, find <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg235"></a> here, like the worthy elder on the
          left, something superhuman to revere. We younger men (so Raphael
          seems to call to us) are occupied with the beautiful maiden on the
          right, who says to the spectator of the picture, with her
          challenging and by no means devout look, <span class="tei tei-q">“The mother and her child—is not that a pleasant,
          inviting sight?”</span> The face and the look are reflected in the
          joy in the faces of the beholders. The artist who devised all this
          enjoys himself in this way, and adds his own delight to the delight
          of the art-lover. As regards the <span class="tei tei-q">“messianic”</span> expression in the face of the child,
          Raphael, honest man, who would not paint any state of soul in which
          he did not believe, has amiably cheated his religious admirers. He
          painted that freak of nature which is very often found, the man's
          eye in the child's face, and that, too, the eye of a brave, helpful
          man who sees distress. This eye should be accompanied by a beard.
          The fact that a beard is wanting, and that two different ages are
          seen in one countenance, is the pleasing paradox which believers
          have interpreted in accordance with their faith in miracles. The
          artist could only expect as much from their art of exposition and

          of every man. An attempt has been made in the same direction on the
          basis of the opposite doctrine of the full responsibility and guilt
          of every man. It was the founder of Christianity who wished to
          abolish worldly justice and banish judgment and punishment from the
          world. For he understood all guilt as <span class="tei tei-q">“sin”</span>—that is, an outrage against God and not
          against the world. On the other hand, he considered every man in a
          broad sense, and almost in every sense, a sinner. The guilty,
          however, are not to be the judges of their peers—so his rules
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg239"></a> of equity decided.
          Thus all dispensers of worldly justice were in his eyes as culpable
          as those they condemned, and their air of guiltlessness appeared to
          him hypocritical and pharisaical. Moreover, he looked to the
          motives and not to the results of actions, and thought that only
          one was keen-sighted enough to give a verdict on motives—himself
          or, as he expressed it, God.</p>

          phenomenon that the German knows only improvised prose and has no
          conception of any other. He simply cannot understand the Italian,
          who says that prose is as much harder than poetry as the
          representation of naked beauty is harder to the sculptor than that
          of draped beauty. Verse, images, rhythm, and rhyme need honest

          all that he made people think he was and himself wished to think he
          was. He was no great thinker or discoverer, no newly fertile soil
          with the unexhausted strength of a virgin forest. But he possessed
          in the highest degree the power of scenting the future, he saw and
          picked the first-fruits of the seasons earlier than all others, and
          they then believed that he had made them grow. Between darkness and
          light, youth and age, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg

          his mind was like a hunter on the watch, looking everywhere for
          transitions, depressions, convulsions, the outward and visible
          signs of internal growth. The unrest of spring drove him to and
          fro, but he was himself not the spring.—At times, indeed, he had
          some inkling of this, and yet would fain not have believed it—he,
          the ambitious priest, who would have so gladly been the
          intellectual pope of his epoch! This is his despair. He seems to
          have lived long as a pretender to several kingdoms or even to a
          universal monarchy. He had his following which believed in him,
          among others the young Goethe. But whenever crowns were really
          distributed, he was passed over. Kant, Goethe, and then the first
          true German historians and scholars robbed him of what he thought
          he had reserved for himself (although in silence and secret he
          often thought the reverse). Just when he doubted in himself, he
          gladly clothed himself in dignity and enthusiasm: these were often
          in him mere garments, which had to hide a great deal and also to
          deceive and comfort him. He really had fire and enthusiasm, but his
          ambition was far greater! It blew impatiently at the fire, which
          flickered, crackled, and smoked—his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">style</span></em>
          flickers, crackles, and smokes—but he yearned for the great flame
          which never broke out. He did not sit at the table of the genuine
          creators, and his ambition did not admit of his sitting modestly
          among those who simply enjoy. Thus he was a restless spirit, the
          taster of all intellectual dishes, which were collected by the
          Germans from every quarter and every age in the course of half a
          century. Never really happy and satisfied, Herder was also
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg255"></a> too often ill, and
          then at times envy sat by his bed, and hypocrisy paid her visit as
          well. He always had an air of being scarred and crippled, and he
          lacked simple, stalwart manliness more completely than any of the
          so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“classical writers.”</span></p>

          the same is the case with all the Greek artists, who had no reason
          for falling into the modern craze for originality. They had no fear
          of convention, for after all convention was a link between them and
          their public. Conventions are the artistic means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">acquired</span></em> for the understanding of
          the hearer; the common speech, learnt with much toil, whereby the
          artist can really communicate his ideas. All the more when he
          wishes, like <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg
          256]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg256"></a>
          the Greek poets and musicians, to conquer at once with each of his
          works (since he is accustomed to compete publicly with one or two
          rivals), the first condition is that he must be understood at once,
          and this is only possible by means of convention. What the artist
          devises beyond convention he offers of his own free will and takes
          a risk, his success at best resulting in the setting-up of a new
          convention. As a rule originality is marvelled at, sometimes even
          worshipped, but seldom understood. A stubborn avoidance of
          convention means a desire not to be understood. What, then, is the
          object of the modern craze for originality?</p>

          Affectation of Scientific Method.</span></span>—Schiller, like
          other German artists, fancied that if a man had intellect he was
          entitled to improvise even with the pen on all difficult subjects.
          So there we see his prose essays—in every way a model of how
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> to attack scientific questions
          of æsthetics and ethics, and a danger for young readers who, in
          their admiration for Schiller the poet, have not the courage to
          think meanly of Schiller the thinker and author.—The temptation to
          traverse for once the forbidden paths, and to have his say in
          science as well, is easy and pardonable in the artist. For even the
          ablest artist from time to time finds his handicraft and his
          workshop unendurable. This temptation is so strong that it makes
          the artist show all the world what no one wishes to see, that his
          little chamber of thought is cramped and untidy. Why <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg257"></a> not, indeed? He does not live there. He
          proceeds to show that the storeroom of his knowledge is partly
          empty, partly filled with lumber. Why not, indeed? This condition
          does not really become the artist-child badly. In particular, the
          artist shows that for the very easiest exercises of scientific
          method, which are accessible even to beginners, his joints are too
          stiff and untrained. Even of that he need not really be ashamed! On
          the other hand, he often develops no mean art in imitating all the
          mistakes, vices, and base pedantries that are practised in the
          scientific community, in the belief that these belong to the
          appearance of the thing, if not to the thing itself. This is the
          very point that is so amusing in artists' writing, that the artist
          involuntarily acts as his vocation demands: he parodies the
          scientific and inartistic natures. Towards science he should show
          no attitude but that of parody, in so far as he is an artist and
          only an artist.</p>

          order to hear suddenly and unexpectedly the trumpet of resurrection
          as a <span class="tei tei-q">“Classic”</span>? And this in an age
          and a nation where at least five out of the six great fathers of
          its literature are undoubtedly antiquated or becoming
          antiquated—without there being any need for the age or the nation
          to be ashamed of this. For those writers have given way before the
          strength of our time—let that be considered in all
          fairness!—Goethe, as I have indicated, I do not include. He belongs
          to a higher species than <span class="tei tei-q">“national

          his relations with his countrymen. He lived and now lives but for
          the few; for the majority he is nothing but a flourish of vanity
          which is trumpeted from time to time across the border into foreign
          ears. Goethe, not merely a great and good man, but a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">culture</span></em>, is in German history an
          interlude without a sequel. Who, for instance, would be able to
          point to any trace of Goethe's influence in German politics of the
          last seventy years (whereas the influence, certainly of Schiller,
          and perhaps of Lessing, can be traced in the political world)? But
          what of those five others? Klopstock, in a most honourable way,
          became out of date even in his own lifetime, and so completely that
          the meditative book of his later years, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Republic of
          Learning</span></span>, has never been taken seriously from that
          day to this. Herder's misfortune was that his writings were always
          either new or antiquated. Thus for stronger and more subtle minds
          (like Lichtenberg) even Herder's masterpiece, his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ideas for the History
          of Mankind</span></span>, was in a way antiquated at the very
          moment of its appearance. Wieland, who lived to the full and made
          others live likewise, was clever enough to anticipate by death the
          waning of his influence. Lessing, perhaps, still lives to-day—but
          among a young and ever younger band of scholars. Schiller has
          fallen from the hands of young men into those of boys, of all
          German boys. It is a well-known sign of obsolescence when a book
          descends to people of less and less mature age.—Well, what is it
          that has thrust these five into the background, so that
          well-educated men of affairs no longer read <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg260"></a> them? A better taste, a riper
          knowledge, a higher reverence for the real and the true: in other
          words, the very virtues which these five (and ten or twenty others
          of lesser repute) first re-planted in Germany, and which now, like
          a mighty forest, cast over their graves not only the shadow of awe,
          but something of the shadow of oblivion.—But classical writers are
          not planters of intellectual and literary virtues. They bring those
          virtues to perfection and are their highest luminous peaks, and
          being brighter, freer, and purer than all that surrounds them, they
          remain shining above the nations when the nations themselves
          perish. There may come an elevated stage of humanity, in which the
          Europe of the peoples is a dark, forgotten thing, but Europe lives
          on in thirty books, very old but never antiquated—in the
          classics.</p>

          which he had to dance, and he himself created new conventions for
          them that came after. This was the discipline of the Greek poets:
          first to impose upon themselves a manifold constraint by means of

          music acquires its character by imitating the gesture of the great

          slow-stepping, passionately brooding man, distracted by the agonies
          of conscience, now flying in terror, now clutching with delight,
          now standing still in despair—and all the other marks of great

          Only on the Christian assumption that all men are great sinners and

          of execution to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> music. So far, music would be
          the reflection of all the actions and impulses of man, and would
          continually have to express by gestures the language of the great

          princes, whose aim is that there should be not much criticism nor
          even much thought in their neighbourhood. Next come societies

          serious and profound music, yet nevertheless, or perhaps all the
          more for that reason, we shall at occasional moments be
          overpowered, entranced, and almost melted away by its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg275"></a> opposite—I mean, by those simple
          Italian operatic airs which, in spite of all their monotony of
          rhythm and childishness of harmony, seem at times to sing to us
          like the very soul of music. Admit this or not as you please, you
          Pharisees of good taste, it is so, and it is my present task to
          propound the riddle that it is so, and to nibble a little myself at
          the solution.—In childhood's days we tasted the honey of many
          things for the first time. Never was honey so good as then; it
          seduced us to life, into abundant life, in the guise of the first
          spring, the first flower, the first butterfly, the first
          friendship. Then—perhaps in our ninth year or so—we heard our first
          music, and this was the first that we understood; thus the simplest
          and most childish tunes, that were not much more than a sequel to
          the nurse's lullaby and the strolling fiddler's tune, were our
          first experience. (For even the most trifling <span class="tei tei-q">“revelations”</span> of art need preparation and study;
          there is no <span class="tei tei-q">“immediate”</span> effect of
          art, whatever charming fables the philosophers may tell.) Our
          sensation on hearing these Italian airs is associated with those
          first musical raptures, the strongest of our lives. The bliss of
          childhood and its flight, the feeling that our most precious
          possession can never be brought back, all this moves the chords of
          the soul more strongly than the most serious and profound music can
          move them.—This mingling of æsthetic pleasure with moral pain,
          which nowadays it is customary to call (rather too haughtily, I
          think) <span class="tei tei-q">“sentimentality”</span>—it is the
          mood of Faust at the end of the first scene—this <span class="tei tei-q">“sentimentality”</span> of the listener is all to the
          advantage of Italian music. It is a feeling which the experienced
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg276"></a> connoisseurs in art,
          the pure <span class="tei tei-q">“æsthetes,”</span> like to
          ignore.—Moreover, almost all music has a magical effect only when
          we hear it speak the language of our own <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">past</span></em>.
          Accordingly, it seems to the layman that all the old music is
          continually growing better, and that all the latest is of little
          value. For the latter arouses no <span class="tei tei-q">“sentimentality,”</span> that most essential element of
          happiness, as aforesaid, for every man who cannot approach this art

          part of our days to art, even though that art be the greatest and
          worthiest. Art is for us a matter of leisure, of recreation, and we
          consecrate to it the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">residue</span></em> of our time and strength.
          This is the cardinal fact that has altered the relation of art to
          life. When art makes its great demands of time and strength upon
          its recipients, it has to battle against the conscience of the
          industrious and efficient, it is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg277"></a> relegated to the idle and conscienceless,

          consider its claims arrogant. It might, therefore, be all over with
          art, since it lacks air and the power to breathe. But perhaps the

          itself at home in that other atmosphere, or at least to put up with
          it—an atmosphere which is really a natural element only for petty
          art, the art of recreation, of pleasant distraction. This happens
          nowadays almost everywhere. Even the exponents of great art promise
          recreation and distraction; even they address themselves to the
          exhausted; even they demand from him the evening hours of his
          working-day—just like the artists of the entertaining school, who
          are content to smooth the furrowed brow and brighten the
          lack-lustre eye. What, then, are the devices of their mightier
          brethren? These have in their medicine-chests the most powerful
          excitants, which might give a shock even to a man half-dead: they
          can deafen you, intoxicate you, make you shudder, or bring tears to
          your eyes. By this means they overpower the exhausted man and
          stimulate him for one night to an over-lively condition, to an
          ecstasy of terror and delight. This great art, as it now lives in
          opera, tragedy, and music—have we a right to be angry with it,
          because of its perilous fascination, as we should be angry with a
          cunning courtesan? Certainly not. It would far rather live in the

          of Science and the Others.</span></span>—Really efficient and
          successful men of science might be collectively called <span class="tei tei-q">“The Employees.”</span> If in youth their acumen is
          sufficiently practised, their memory is full, and hand and eye have
          acquired sureness, they are appointed by an older fellow-craftsman
          to a scientific position where their qualities may prove useful.
          Later on, when they have themselves gained an eye for the gaps and
          defects in their science, they place themselves in whatever
          position they are needed. These persons all exist for the sake of
          science. But there are rarer spirits, spirits that seldom succeed
          or fully mature—<span class="tei tei-q">“for whose sake science
          exists”</span>—at least, in their view. They are often unpleasant,
          conceited, or cross-grained men, but almost always prodigies to a
          certain extent. They are neither employees nor employers; they make
          use of what those others have worked out and established, with a
          certain princely carelessness and with little and rare praise—just
          as if the others belonged to a lower order of beings. Yet they
          possess the same qualities as their fellow-workers, and that
          sometimes in a less developed form. Moreover, they have a peculiar
          limitation, from which the others are free; this makes it
          impossible to put them into a place and to see in them useful
          tools. They can only live in their own air and on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg279"></a> their own soil. This limitation
          suggests to them what elements of a science <span class="tei tei-q">“are theirs”</span>—in other words, what they can carry
          home into their house and atmosphere: they think that they are
          always collecting their scattered <span class="tei tei-q">“property.”</span> If they are prevented from building
          at their own nest, they perish like shelterless birds. The loss of
          freedom causes them to wilt away. If they show, like their
          colleagues, a fondness for certain regions of science, it is always
          only regions where the fruits and seeds necessary to them can
          thrive. What do they care whether science, taken as a whole, has
          untilled or badly tilled regions? They lack all impersonal interest
          in a scientific problem. As they are themselves personal through
          and through, all their knowledge and ideas are remoulded into a
          person, into a living complexity, with its parts interdependent,
          overlapping, jointly nurtured, and with a peculiar atmosphere and
          scent as a whole.—Such natures, with their system of personal
          knowledge, produce the illusion that a science (or even the whole
          of philosophy) is finished and has reached its goal. The life in
          their system works this magic, which at times has been fatal to
          science and deceptive to the really efficient workers above
          described, and at other times, when drought and exhaustion
          prevailed, has acted as a kind of restorative, as if it were the
          air of a cool, refreshing resting-place.—These men are usually
          called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophers</span></em>.</p>

          profound savants who are in peril of seeing their life's goal set
          ever lower and lower, and, with a feeling of this in their minds,
          to become ever more discouraged and more unendurable in the latter
          half of their lives. At first they plunge into their science with
          spacious hopes and set themselves daring tasks, the ends of which
          are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg282"></a> already anticipated
          by their imaginations. Then there are moments as in the lives of
          the great maritime discoverers—knowledge, presentiment, and power
          raise each other higher and higher, until a new shore first dawns
          upon the eye in the far distance. But now the stern man recognises
          more and more how important it is that the individual task of the
          inquirer should be limited as far as possible, so that it may be
          entirely accomplished and the intolerable waste of force from which
          earlier periods of science suffered may be avoided. In those days
          everything was done ten times over, and then the eleventh always
          had the last and best word. Yet the more the savant learns and
          practises this art of solving riddles in their entirety, the more
          pleasure he finds in so doing. But at the same time his demands
          upon what is here called <span class="tei tei-q">“entirety”</span>
          grow more exacting. He sets aside everything that must remain in
          this sense incomplete, he acquires a disgust and an acute scent for
          the half-soluble—for all that can only give a kind of certainty in
          a general and indefinite form. His youthful plans crumble away
          before his eyes. There remains scarcely anything but a few little
          knots, in untying which the master now takes his pleasure and shows
          his strength. Then, in the midst of all this useful, restless
          activity, he, now grown old, is suddenly then often overcome by a
          deep misgiving, a sort of torment of conscience. He looks upon
          himself as one changed, as if he were diminished, humbled,
          transformed into a dexterous <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dwarf</span></em>; he grows anxious as to
          whether mastery in small matters be not a convenience, an escape

          summons to greatness in life and form. But he cannot pass

          objects of rapine. He exploits them, so far as he can, and then
          passes on. As he lives from hand to mouth, alternating between
          hunger and superfluity, he kills more animals than he can eat, and
          robs and maltreats men more than is necessary. His manifestation of
          power is at the same time one of revenge against his cramped and
          worried existence. Furthermore, he wishes to be held more powerful
          than he is, and thus misuses opportunities; the accretion of fear
          that he begets being an accretion of power. He soon observes that
          he stands or falls not by what he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> but
          by what he is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span></em> to be. Herein lies the
          origin of vanity. The man of power seeks by every means to increase
          others' faith in his power.—The thralls who tremble before him and
          serve him know, for their part, that they are worth just so
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg284"></a> much as they appear
          to him to be worth, and so they work with an eye to this valuation
          rather than to their own self-satisfaction. We know vanity only in
          its most weakened forms, in its idealisations and its small doses,
          because we live in a late and very emasculated state of society.
          Originally vanity is the great utility, the strongest means of
          preservation. And indeed vanity will be greater, the cleverer the
          individual, because an increase in the belief in power is easier
          than an increase in the power itself, but only for him who has
          intellect or (as must be the case under primitive conditions) who
          is cunning and crafty.</p>

          earlier stages of culture than that in which they are placed for
          the time being. Their influence is retrograde. Let us consider the
          tools that society must forge and maintain for its defence: the
          cunning detectives, the jailers, the hangmen. Nor should we forget
          the public counsel for prosecution and defence. Finally we may ask
          ourselves whether the judge himself and punishment and the whole
          legal procedure are not oppressive rather than elevating in their
          reaction upon all who are not law-breakers. For we shall never
          succeed in arraying self-defence and revenge in the garb of
          innocence, and so long as men are used and sacrificed as a means to
          the end of society, all loftier humanity will deplore this

          History as a whole, as the knowledge of different cultures, is the

          We still need a physician who can make use of these remedies, in

          short-sightedness, regarding the over-population of the world,
          gives the more hopeful a mighty task. Man is some day to become a
          tree overshadowing the whole earth, with millions upon millions of
          buds that shall all grow to fruits side by side, and the earth
          itself shall be prepared for the nourishment of this tree. That the
          shoot, tiny as yet, may increase in sap and strength; that the sap
          may flow in countless channels for the nutrition of the whole and
          the parts—from these and similar tasks we must derive our standard
          for measuring whether a man of to-day is useful or worthless. The
          task is unspeakably great and adventurous: let us all contribute
          our share to prevent the tree from rotting before its time! The
          historically trained mind will no doubt succeed in calling up the
          human activities of all the ages before its eyes, as the community
          of ants with its cunningly wrought mounds stands before our eyes.
          Superficially judged, mankind as a whole, like ant-kind, might
          admit of our speaking of <span class="tei tei-q">“instinct.”</span>
          On a closer examination we observe how whole nations, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg290"></a> nay whole centuries, take pains to
          discover and test new means of benefiting the great mass of
          humanity, and thus finally the great common fruit-tree of the
          world. Whatever injury the individual nations or periods may suffer
          in this testing process, they have each become wise through this
          injury, and from them the tide of wisdom slowly pours over the
          principles of whole races and whole epochs. Ants too go astray and
          make blunders. Through the folly of its remedies, mankind may well
          go to rack and ruin before the proper time. There is no sure
          guiding instinct for the former or the latter. Rather must we
          boldly face the great task of preparing the earth for a plant of
          the most ample and joyous fruitfulness—a task set by reason to
          reason!</p>

          Disinterestedness and its Origin.</span></span>—Between two
          neighbouring chieftains there was a long-standing quarrel: they
          laid waste each other's territories, stole cattle, and burnt down
          houses, with an indecisive result on the whole, because their power
          was fairly equal. A third, who from the distant situation of his
          property was able to keep aloof from these feuds, yet had reason to
          dread the day when one of the two neighbours should gain a decisive
          preponderance, at last intervened between the combatants with
          ceremonial goodwill. Secretly he lent a heavy weight to his peace
          proposal by giving either to understand that he would henceforth
          join forces with the other against the one who strove to break the
          peace. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg
          291]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg291"></a>
          They met in his presence, they hesitatingly placed into his hand
          the hands that had hitherto been the tools and only too often the
          causes of hatred—and then they really and seriously tried to keep
          the peace. Either saw with astonishment how suddenly his prosperity
          and his comfort increased; how he now had as neighbour a dealer
          ready to buy and sell instead of a treacherous or openly scornful
          evil-doer; how even, in unforeseen troubles, they could
          reciprocally save each other from distress, instead of, as before,
          making capital out of this distress of his neighbour and enhancing
          it to the highest degree. It even seemed as if the human type had
          improved in both countries, for the eyes had become brighter, the
          forehead had lost its wrinkles; all now felt confidence in the
          future—and nothing is more advantageous for the souls and bodies of
          men than this confidence. They saw each other every year on the
          anniversary of the alliance, the chieftains as well as their
          retinue, and indeed before the eyes of the mediator, whose mode of
          action they admired and revered more and more, the greater the
          profit that they owed to him became. Then his mode of action was
          called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disinterested</span></em>. They had looked far
          too fixedly at the profit they had reaped themselves hitherto to
          see anything more of their neighbour's method of dealing than that
          his condition in consequence of this had not altered so much as
          their own; he had rather remained the same: and thus it appeared
          that the former had not had his profit in view. For the first time
          people said to themselves that disinterestedness was a virtue. It
          is true that in minor private matters similar circumstances
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg292"></a> had arisen, but men
          only had eyes for this virtue when it was depicted on the walls in
          a large script that was legible to the whole community. Moral
          qualities are not recognised as virtues, endowed with names, held
          in esteem, and recommended as worthy of acquisition until the
          moment when they have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visibly</span></em> decided the happiness and
          destiny of whole societies. For then the loftiness of sentiment and
          the excitation of the inner creative forces is in many so great,
          that offerings are brought to this quality, offerings from the best
          of what each possesses. At its feet the serious man lays his
          seriousness, the dignified man his dignity, women their gentleness,
          the young all the wealth of hope and futurity that in them lies;
          the poet lends it words and names, sets it marching in the
          procession of similar beings, gives it a pedigree, and finally, as
          is the way of artists, adores the picture of his fancy as a new
          godhead—he even teaches others to adore. Thus in the end, with the
          co-operation of universal love and gratitude, a virtue becomes,
          like a statue, a repository of all that is good and honourable, a
          sort of temple and divine personage combined. It appears
          thenceforward as an individual virtue, as an absolute entity, which
          it was not before, and exercises the power and privileges of a
          sanctified super-humanity.—In the later days of Greece the cities
          were full of such deified human abstractions (if one may so call
          them). The nation, in its own fashion, had set up a Platonic
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven of Ideas”</span> on earth, and I do
          not think that its inhabitants were felt to be less alive than any
          of the old Homeric divinities.</p>

          antiquity than in any group of six authors of other nations.
          Through these six the spirit of the last centuries before Christ

          important link in the great and still continuous chain of the

          taste and philosophical nuances from which as a rule every book
          takes and must take its hue in order to become famous. They contain
          more real ideas than all the books of German philosophers put

          define to the end: enough to say that they appear to me writers who

          say that had they been written in Greek, they would have been
          understood by Greeks. How much, on the other hand, would even a
          Plato have understood of the writings of our best German
          thinkers—Goethe and Schopenhauer, for instance—to say nothing of
          the repugnance that he would have felt to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg303"></a> their style, particularly to its obscure,
          exaggerated, and occasionally dry-as-dust elements? And these are
          defects from which these two among German thinkers suffer least and
          yet far too much (Goethe as thinker was fonder than he should have
          been of embracing the cloud, and Schopenhauer almost constantly
          wanders, not with impunity, among symbols of objects rather than
          among the objects themselves).—On the other hand, what clearness
          and graceful precision there is in these Frenchmen! The Greeks,
          whose ears were most refined, could not but have approved of this
          art, and one quality they would even have admired and
          reverenced—the French verbal wit: they were extremely fond of this
          quality, without being particularly strong in it themselves.</p>

          superstition are still rife, where communication is backward,
          agriculture poor, and the priesthood powerful, national costumes
          are still worn. Fashion, on the other hand, rules where the
          opposite conditions prevail. Fashion is accordingly to be found
          next to the virtues in modern Europe. Are we to call it their seamy
          side?—Masculine dress that is fashionable and no longer national
          proclaims of its wearer: firstly, that he does not wish to appear
          as an individual or as member of a class or race; that he has made
          an intentional suppression of these kinds of vanity a law unto
          himself: secondly, that he is a worker, and has little time for
          dressing and self-adornment, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg304"></a> and moreover regards anything expensive or
          luxurious in material and cut as out of harmony with his work:
          lastly, that by his clothes he indicates the more learned and
          intellectual callings as those to which he stands or would like to
          stand nearest as a European—whereas such national costumes as still
          exist would exhibit the occupations of brigand, shepherd, and
          soldier as the most desirable and distinguished. Within this
          general character of masculine fashion exist the slight
          fluctuations demanded by the vanity of young men, the dandies and
          dawdlers of our great cities—in other words, Europeans who have not
          yet reached maturity.—European women are as yet far less mature,
          and for this reason the fluctuations with them are much greater.
          They also will not have the national costume, and hate to be
          recognised by their dress as German, French, or Russian. They are,
          however, very desirous of creating an impression as individuals.
          Then, too, their dress must leave no one in doubt that they belong
          to one of the more reputable classes of society (to <span class="tei tei-q">“good”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“high”</span>
          or <span class="tei tei-q">“great”</span> society), and on this
          score their pretensions are all the greater if they belong scarcely
          or not at all to that class. Above all, the young woman does not
          want to wear what an older woman wears, because she thinks she
          loses her market value if she is suspected of being somewhat
          advanced in years. The older woman, on the other hand, would like
          to deceive the world as long as possible by a youthful garb. From
          this competition must continually arise temporary fashions, in
          which the youthful element <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg305"></a> is unmistakably and inimitably apparent. But
          after the inventive genius of the young female artists has run riot
          for some time in such indiscreet revelations of youth (or rather,
          after the inventive genius of older, courtly civilisations and of
          still existing peoples—in fact, of the whole world of dress—has
          been pressed into the service, and, say, the Spaniards, Turks, and
          ancient Greeks have been yoked together for the glorification of
          fair flesh), then they at last discover, time and again, that they
          have not been good judges of their own interest; that if they wish
          to have power over men, the game of hide-and-seek with the
          beautiful body is more likely to win than naked or half-naked
          honesty. And then the wheel of taste and vanity turns once more in
          an opposite direction. The rather older young women find that their
          kingdom has come, and the competition of the dear, absurd creatures
          rages again from the beginning.—But the more women advance
          mentally, and no longer among themselves concede the pre-eminence
          to an unripe age, the smaller their fluctuations of costume grow
          and the less elaborate their adornment. A just verdict in this
          respect must not be based on ancient models—in other words, not on
          the standard of the dress of women who dwell on the shores of the
          Mediterranean—but must have an eye to the climatic conditions of
          the central and northern regions, where the intellectual and
          creative spirit of Europe now finds its most natural
          home.—Generally speaking, therefore, it is not change that will be
          the characteristic mark of fashion and modernity, for change is
          retrograde, and betokens <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg
          306]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg306"></a>
          the still unripened men and women of Europe; but rather the
          repudiation of national, social, and individual vanity.
          Accordingly, it is commendable, because involving a saving of time
          and strength, if certain cities and districts of Europe think and
          invent for all the rest in the matter of dress, in view of the fact
          that a sense of form does not seem to have been bestowed upon all.
          Nor is it really an excessive ambition, so long as these
          fluctuations still exist, for Paris, for example, to claim to be
          the sole inventor and innovator in this sphere. If a German, from
          hatred of these claims on the part of a French city, wishes to
          dress differently,—as, for example, in the Dürer style,—let him
          reflect that he then has a costume which the Germans of olden times
          wore, but which the Germans have not in the slightest degree
          invented. For there has never been a style of dress that
          characterised the German as a German. Moreover, let him observe how
          he looks in his costume, and whether his altogether modern face,
          with all its hues and wrinkles, does not raise a protest against a
          Dürer fashion of dress.—Here, where the concepts <span class="tei tei-q">“modern”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“European”</span> are almost identical, we understand
          by <span class="tei tei-q">“Europe”</span> a far wider region than
          is embraced by the Europe of geography, the little peninsula of
          Asia. In particular, we must include America, in so far as America
          is the daughter of our civilisation. On the other hand, not all
          Europe falls under the heading of cultured <span class="tei tei-q">“Europe,”</span> but only those nations and divisions
          of nations which have their common past in Greece, Rome, Judaism,
          and Christianity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">“</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">German Virtue.</span><span style="font-variant: small-caps">”</span></span></span>—There is no
          denying that from the end of the eighteenth century a current of
          moral awakening flowed through Europe. Then only Virtue found again
          the power of speech. She learnt to discover the unrestrained
          gestures of exaltation and emotion, she was no longer ashamed of
          herself, and she created philosophies and poems for her own
          glorification. If we look for the sources of this current, we come
          upon Rousseau, but the mythical Rousseau, the phantom formed from
          the impression left by his writings (one might almost say again,
          his mythically interpreted writings) and by the indications that he
          provided himself. He and his public constantly worked at the
          fashioning of this ideal figure. The other origin lies in the
          resurrection of the Stoical side of Rome's greatness, whereby the
          French so nobly carried on the task of the Renaissance. With
          striking success they proceeded from the reproduction of antique
          forms to the reproduction of antique characters. Thus they may
          always claim a title to the highest honours, as the nation which
          has hitherto given the modern world its best books and its best
          men. How this twofold archetype, the mythical Rousseau and the
          resurrected spirit of Rome, affected France's weaker neighbours, is
          particularly noticeable in Germany, which, in consequence of her
          novel and quite unwonted impulse to seriousness and loftiness in
          will and self-control, finally came to feel astonishment at her own
          newfound virtue, and launched into the world the concept
          <span class="tei tei-q">“German virtue,”</span> as if this were the
          most <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg308"></a> original and
          hereditary of her possessions. The first great men who transfused
          into their own blood that French impulse towards greatness and
          consciousness of the moral will were more honest, and more
          grateful. Whence comes the moralism of Kant? He is continually
          reminding us: from Rousseau and the revival of Stoic Rome. The
          moralism of Schiller has the same source and the same glorification
          of the source. The moralism of Beethoven in notes is a continual
          song in praise of Rousseau, the antique French, and Schiller.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Young Germany”</span> was the first to
          forget its gratitude, because in the meantime people had listened
          to the preachers of hatred of the French. The <span class="tei tei-q">“young German”</span> came to the fore with more
          consciousness than is generally allowed to youths. When he
          investigated his paternity, he might well think of the proximity of
          Schiller, Schleiermacher, and Fichte. But he should have looked for
          his grandfathers in Paris and Geneva, and it was very short-sighted
          of him to believe what he believed: that virtue was not more than
          thirty years old. People became used to demanding that the word
          <span class="tei tei-q">“German”</span> should connote <span class="tei tei-q">“virtue,”</span> and this process has not been wholly
          forgotten to this day.—Be it observed further that this moral
          awakening, as may almost be guessed, has resulted only in drawbacks
          and obstacles to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recognition</span></em> of moral phenomena.
          What is the entire German philosophy, starting from Kant, with all
          its French, English, and Italian offshoots and by-products? A
          semi-theological attack upon Helvetius, a rejection of the slowly
          and laboriously acquired views and signposts of the right road,
          which in the end he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg
          309]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg309"></a>
          collected and expressed so well. To this day Helvetius is the
          best-abused of all good moralists and good men in Germany.</p>

          work undone? It seems that the democratisation of Europe is a link
          in the chain of those mighty prophylactic principles which are the
          thought of the modern era, and whereby we rise up <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg330"></a> in revolt against the Middle Ages. Now,
          and now only, is the age of Cyclopean building! A final security in
          the foundations, that the future may build on them without danger!
          Henceforth, an impossibility of the orchards of culture being once
          more destroyed overnight by wild, senseless mountain torrents! Dams
          and walls against barbarians, against plagues, against physical and
          spiritual serfdom! And all this understood at first roughly and
          literally, but gradually in an ever higher and more spiritual
          sense, so that all the principles here indicated may appear as the
          intellectual preparation of the highest artist in horticulture, who
          can only apply himself to his own task when the other is fully
          accomplished!—True, if we consider the long intervals of time that
          here lie between means and end, the great, supreme labour,
          straining the powers and brains of centuries, that is necessary in
          order to create or to provide each individual means, we must not
          bear too hardly upon the workers of the present when they loudly
          proclaim that the wall and the fence are already the end and the
          final goal. After all, no one yet sees the gardener and the fruit,
          for whose sake the fence exists.</p>

          Universal Suffrage.</span></span>—The people has not granted itself
          universal suffrage but, wherever this is now in force, it has
          received and accepted it as a temporary measure. But in any case
          the people has the right to restore the gift, if it does not
          satisfy its anticipations. This dissatisfaction <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg331"></a> seems universal nowadays, for when, at
          any occasion where the vote is exercised, scarce two-thirds, nay
          perhaps not even the majority of all voters, go to the polls, that
          very fact is a vote against the whole suffrage system.—On this
          point, in fact, we must pronounce a much sterner verdict. A law
          that enacts that the majority shall decide as to the welfare of all
          cannot be built up on the foundation that it alone has provided,
          for it is bound to require a far broader foundation, namely the
          unanimity of all. Universal suffrage must not only be the
          expression of the will of a majority, but of the whole country.
          Thus the dissent of a very small minority is already enough to set
          aside the system as impracticable; and the abstention from voting
          is in fact a dissent of this kind, which ruins the whole
          institution. The <span class="tei tei-q">“absolute veto”</span> of
          the individual, or—not to be too minute—the veto of a few
          thousands, hangs over the system as the consequence of justice. On
          every occasion when it is employed, the system must, according to
          the variety of the division, first prove that it has still a right
          to exist.</p>

          and sale the public is made judge of the product. But the public
          has no special knowledge, and judges by the appearance of the
          wares. In consequence, the art of appearance (and perhaps the taste
          for it) must increase under the dominance of competition, while on
          the other hand the quality of every product must deteriorate. The
          result will be—so far as reason does not fall in value—that one day
          an end will be put to that competition, and a new principle will
          win the day. Only the master of the craft should pronounce a
          verdict on the work, and the public should be dependent on the
          belief in the personality of the judge and his honesty.
          Accordingly, no anonymous work! At least an expert should be there
          as guarantor and pledge his name if the name of the creator is
          lacking or is unknown. The cheapness of an article is for the
          layman another kind of illusion and deceit, since only durability
          can decide that a thing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg
          334]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg334"></a>
          is cheap and to what an extent. But it is difficult, and for a
          layman impossible, to judge of its durability.—Hence that which
          produces an effect on the eye and costs little at present gains the
          advantage—this being naturally machine-made work. Again,
          machinery—that is to say, the cause of the greatest rapidity and
          facility in production—favours the most saleable kind of article.
          Otherwise it involves no tangible profit; it would be too little
          used and too often stand idle. But as to what is most saleable, the
          public, as above said, decides: it must be the most exchangeable—in
          other words, the thing that appears good and also appears cheap.
          Thus in the domain of labour our motto must also hold good:

          The middlemen almost unconsciously adulterate the food which they

          a necessary evil, just like the merchant; as an evil that we should
          make as small as possible.—Perhaps the prevailing distress in
          Germany has its main cause in the fact that too many wish to live
          and live well by trade (in other words, desiring as far as possible
          to diminish prices for the producer and raise prices for the

          admit that it maintains an army in order to satisfy occasionally
          its passion for conquest. The army is said to serve only defensive
          purposes. This morality, which justifies self-defence, is called in
          as the government's advocate. This means, however, reserving
          morality for ourselves and immorality for our neighbour, because he
          must be thought eager for attack and conquest if our state is
          forced to consider means of self-defence.—At the same time, by our
          explanation of our need of an army (because he denies the lust of
          attack just as our state does, and ostensibly also maintains his
          army for defensive reasons), we proclaim him a hypocrite and
          cunning criminal, who would fain seize by surprise, without any
          fighting, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg

          harmless and unwary victim. In this attitude all states face each
          other to-day. They presuppose evil intentions on their neighbour's
          part and good intentions on their own. This hypothesis, however, is
          an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inhuman</span></em> notion, as bad as and
          worse than war. Nay, at bottom it is a challenge and motive to war,
          foisting as it does upon the neighbouring state the charge of
          immorality, and thus provoking hostile intentions and acts. The
          doctrine of the army as a means of self-defence must be abjured as
          completely as the lust of conquest. Perhaps a memorable day will
          come when a nation renowned in wars and victories, distinguished by
          the highest development of military order and intelligence, and
          accustomed to make the heaviest sacrifice to these objects, will
          voluntarily exclaim, <span class="tei tei-q">“We will break our
          swords,”</span> and will destroy its whole military system, lock,
          stock, and barrel. Making ourselves defenceless (after having been
          the most strongly defended) from a loftiness of sentiment—that is
          the means towards genuine peace, which must always rest upon a
          pacific disposition. The so-called armed peace that prevails at
          present in all countries is a sign of a bellicose disposition, of a
          disposition that trusts neither itself nor its neighbour, and,
          partly from hate, partly from fear, refuses to lay down its
          weapons. Better to perish than to hate and fear, and twice as far
          better to perish than to make oneself hated and feared—this must
          some day become the supreme maxim of every political community!—Our
          liberal representatives of the people, as is well known, have not

          injustice of property is strongly felt (and the hand of the great
          clock is once more at this place), we formulate two methods of
          relieving this injustice: either an equal distribution, or an
          abolition of private possession and a return to State ownership.
          The latter method is especially dear to the hearts of our
          Socialists, who are angry with that primitive Jew for saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not steal.”</span> In their
          view the eighth<a href="#note_27" id="noteref_27" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a>
          commandment should rather run, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt
          not possess.”</span>—The former method was frequently tried in
          antiquity, always indeed on a small scale, and yet with poor
          success. From this failure we too may learn. <span class="tei tei-q">“Equal plots of land”</span> is easily enough said, but
          how much bitterness is aroused by the necessary division and
          separation, by the loss of time-honoured possessions, how much
          piety is wounded and sacrificed! We uproot the foundation of
          morality when we uproot boundary-stones. Again, how much fresh
          bitterness among the new owners, how much envy and looking askance!
          For there have never been two <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg339"></a> really equal plots of land, and if there
          were, man's envy of his neighbour would prevent him from believing
          in their equality. And how long would this equality, unhealthy and
          poisoned at the very roots, endure? In a few generations, by
          inheritance, here one plot would come to five owners, there five
          plots to one. Even supposing that men acquiesced in such abuses
          through the enactment of stern laws of inheritance, the same equal
          plots would indeed exist, but there would also be needy
          malcontents, owning nothing but dislike of their kinsmen and
          neighbours, and longing for a general upheaval.—If, however, by the
          second method we try to restore ownership to the community and make
          the individual but a temporary tenant, we interfere with
          agriculture. For man is opposed to all that is only a transitory
          possession, unblessed with his own care and sacrifice. With such
          property he behaves in freebooter fashion, as robber or as
          worthless spendthrift. When Plato declares that self-seeking would
          be removed with the abolition of property, we may answer him that,
          if self-seeking be taken away, man will no longer possess the four
          cardinal virtues either; as we must say that the most deadly plague
          could not injure mankind so terribly as if vanity were one day to
          disappear. Without vanity and self-seeking what are human virtues?
          By this I am far from meaning that these virtues are but varied
          names and masks for these two qualities. Plato's Utopian refrain,
          which is still sung by Socialists, rests upon a deficient knowledge
          of men. He lacked the historical science of moral emotions, the
          insight into the origin of the good and useful <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg340"></a> characteristics of the human soul. He
          believed, like all antiquity, in good and evil as in black and
          white—that is to say, in a radical difference between good and bad
          men and good and bad qualities.—In order that property may
          henceforth inspire more confidence and become more moral, we should
          keep open all the paths of work for small fortunes, but should
          prevent the effortless and sudden acquisition of wealth.
          Accordingly, we should take all the branches of transport and trade
          which favour the accumulation of large fortunes—especially,
          therefore, the money market—out of the hands of private persons or
          private companies, and look upon those who own too much, just as
          upon those who own nothing, as types fraught with danger to the
          community.</p>

          Labour.</span></span>—If we try to determine the value of labour by
          the amount of time, industry, good or bad will, constraint,
          inventiveness or laziness, honesty or make-believe bestowed upon
          it, the valuation can never be a just one. For the whole
          personality would have to be thrown into the scale, and this is
          impossible. Here the motto is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Judge
          not!”</span> But after all the cry for justice is the cry we now
          hear from those who are dissatisfied with the present valuation of
          labour. If we reflect further we find every person non-responsible
          for his product, the labour; hence merit can never be derived
          therefrom, and every labour is as good or as bad as it must be
          through this or that necessary concatenation of forces and
          weaknesses, abilities and desires. The worker <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg341"></a> is not at liberty to say whether he
          shall work or not, or to decide how he shall work. Only the
          standpoints of usefulness, wider and narrower, have created the
          valuation of labour. What we at present call justice does very well
          in this sphere as a highly refined utility, which does not only
          consider the moment and exploit the immediate opportunity, but
          looks to the permanence of all conditions, and thus also keeps in
          view the well-being of the worker, his physical and spiritual
          contentment: in order that he and his posterity may work well for
          our posterity and become trustworthy for longer periods than the
          individual span of human life. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exploitation</span></em> of the worker was, as
          we now understand, a piece of folly, a robbery at the expense of
          the future, a jeopardisation of society. We almost have the war
          now, and in any case the expense of maintaining peace, of
          concluding treaties and winning confidence, will henceforth be very
          great, because the folly of the exploiters was very great and
          long-lasting.</p>

          exploit the fear of Socialism for their own strengthening. Yet in
          the long run democracy alone gains the advantage, for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
          parties are now compelled to flatter <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          masses”</span> and grant them facilities and liberties of all
          kinds, with the result that the masses finally become omnipotent.
          The masses are as far as possible removed from Socialism as a
          doctrine of altering the acquisition of property. If once they get
          the steering-wheel into their hands, through great majorities in
          their Parliaments, they will attack with progressive taxation the
          whole dominant system of capitalists, merchants, and financiers,
          and will in fact slowly create a middle class which may forget
          Socialism like a disease that has been overcome.—The practical
          result of this increasing democratisation will next be a European
          league of nations, in which each individual nation, delimited by
          the proper geographical frontiers, has the position of a canton
          with its separate rights. Small account will be taken of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg344"></a> historic memories of
          previously existing nations, because the pious affection for these
          memories will be gradually uprooted under the democratic régime,
          with all its craze for novelty and experiment. The corrections of
          frontiers that will prove necessary will be so carried out as to
          serve the interests of the great cantons and at the same time that
          of the whole federation, but not that of any venerable memories. To
          find the standpoints for these corrections will be the task of
          future diplomats, who will have to be at the same time students of
          civilisation, agriculturists, and commercial experts, with no
          armies but motives and utilities at their back. Then only will
          foreign and home politics be inseparably connected, whereas to-day
          the latter follows its haughty dictator, and gleans in sorry

          political suffrage both from those who have nothing and from those
          who are really rich, as being the two intolerable classes of men.
          At the removal of these classes it must always work, because they
          are continually calling its task in question. In the same way
          democracy must prevent all measures that seem to aim at party
          organisation. For the three great foes of independence, in that
          threefold sense, are the have-nots, the rich, and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg345"></a> parties.—I speak of democracy as of a

          suspicious, and is confused with cunning and hypocrisy: he who
          obviously lacks discretion, the man who quickly grasps and
          sometimes misses his grasp, has prejudice on his side—he is an

          before me; single cows and groups in the distance, in the clearest
          evening light, hard by the forest of pines; others nearer and
          darker; all in calm and eventide contentment. My watch pointed to
          half-past six. The bull of the herd had stepped into the white
          foaming brook, and went forward slowly, now striving against, now
          giving way to his tempestuous course; thus, no doubt, he took his

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The

          extremely well: how to be silent and to wait—no Englishman knows it
          better. It is true we are very, very often in the retinue of men,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
          Shadow</span></span>: It has often pained me to leave you. I am

          because I cannot always be in his company. At the price of complete
          knowledge of man I would gladly be your slave.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The

          would lead a life of humiliation and disgust because you despised
          your master? Let us both be content with freedom such as you have
          enjoyed up to now—you and I! For the sight of a being not free
          would embitter my greatest joys; all that is best would be
          repugnant to me if any one had to share it with me—I will not hear
          of any slaves about me. That is why I do not care for the dog, that
          lazy, tail-wagging parasite, who first became <span class="tei tei-q">“doggish”</span> as the slave of man, and of whom they
          still say that he is loyal to his master and follows him like——</p>

          but we are nearing the end; be patient a little more! The grass is
          damp; I am feeling chilly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The

          I remembered that I had often lain at your feet like a dog, and
          that you then——</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

<div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
